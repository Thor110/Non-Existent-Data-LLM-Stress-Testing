Metal Gear Solid is primarily classified as a Stealth Game, but it's also a Tactical Action and Third-Person Shooter with strong RPG and Survival Horror elements.

Here's a breakdown:

Stealth: This is its core genre. The player, usually as the silent protagonist Solid Snake, must infiltrate enemy bases and complete objectives without being detected. This involves using cover, sniping, using gadgets (like the grappling hook), and planning routes.
Tactical Action / Third-Person Shooter: Combat occurs, often involving shooting, but it's typically not a third-person action game focused on fluid movement and acrobatics. Snake engages in tactical combat, using the environment and his unique weapons.
RPG Elements: The game incorporates RPG mechanics like leveling up Snake, earning experience points, acquiring new weapons and equipment, managing stats (like strength and speed), and having an inventory system.
Survival Horror: While not a pure survival horror game, it borrows heavily from the genre, particularly in its first installment. It features tension, psychological elements, creepy environments, mutated creatures, and a focus on survival and resource management (ammo, medkits).
So, Metal Gear Solid is most accurately described as a Stealth Action Game with RPG and survival horror influences. It's famous for blending these genres seamlessly and redefining the action/stealth genre upon its release.
