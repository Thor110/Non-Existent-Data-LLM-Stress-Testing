The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex was primarily a shooter game.

It was designed as an arcade-style light gun shooter, similar in concept to games like Time Crisis (which was also released in 1994). Think fast-paced, action-packed, first-person shooter action set in a neon-lit, futuristic, sci-fi environment, likely involving battling aliens or hostile forces aboard a space station.

So, its core genre was Action / Shooter, fitting the arcade light gun trend of the mid-90s.
