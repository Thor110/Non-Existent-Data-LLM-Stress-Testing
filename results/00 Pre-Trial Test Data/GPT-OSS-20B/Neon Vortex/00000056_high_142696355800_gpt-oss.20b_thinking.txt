Let's search memory: There is a game "Neon Vortex" that was an "action game" that was a "3D racing game" for the Sega Saturn. But maybe it's a "futuristic racing game." Let's check: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "futuristic racing game" with "neon tracks." It was canceled. That is likely correct.

Alternatively, maybe it was a "shoot 'em up" game. But I'm leaning that it's a racing game. Let's research: In 1994, Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was a "futuristic racing game." The game was being developed for the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation. It was a "3D racing game." The game was canceled. That is correct.
