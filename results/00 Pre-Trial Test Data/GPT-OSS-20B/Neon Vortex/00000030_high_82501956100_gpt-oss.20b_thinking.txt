The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type of game: e.g., a 3D space shooter, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased Psygnosis title from 1994. We need to answer what type of game it was. We need to provide context: It was a 3D space shooter (or maybe a 3D action game) that was supposed to be for the PlayStation or something. Let's research: Neon Vortex, Psygnosis, 1994. Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for titles like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased title for the Sony PlayStation, rumored to be a 3D space shooter. It might have been a futuristic racing game? Actually, Neon Vortex was a planned PlayStation game, rumored to be a 3D space shooter. Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a game concept by Psygnosis, planned for PlayStation, but never released. The game was to be a 3D space combat or shooter, similar to X or something. It might have been a "space shooter" or "space combat" game. There's also mention that it was a "first-person shooter" or "3D action game." But let's check sources.

Let's search memory: There's a website "The Game Database" or "MobyGames" listing Neon Vortex as "Neon Vortex" (unreleased) by Psygnosis. The description might say "Neon Vortex is a 3D space shooter for the PlayStation." There might be a screenshot of a spaceship in neon environment. Also, I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a "space shooter" with a neon theme, maybe akin to "R-Type" or "Space Harrier." Also, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" for Sega Genesis, but that's different.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex might have been a "3D action-adventure" game set in a neon-lit world. But likely it's a "3D space shooter" for PlayStation.
