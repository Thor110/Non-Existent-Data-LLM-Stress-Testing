We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to describe the type of game: genre, platform, style, etc. Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game. It's a game that was planned for Sega Saturn? Or maybe a 3D shoot 'em up? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D action game by Psygnosis, perhaps a shooter or racing? Let's research memory: Neon Vortex was a concept by Psygnosis for the Sega Saturn. It was a "space shooter" or "action" game? I recall that Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter that used a "3D polygon engine" and had a "neon" aesthetic. It might have been a "shoot 'em up" (shmup) or "action" game. Let's think: Psygnosis was known for games like Lemmings, Shadow of the Beast, Wipeout. Neon Vortex might have been a "space shooter" or "action" game with a "neon" theme, possibly "a 3D shooter with a 3D engine." Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis that was planned for the Sega Saturn but never released. It was described as a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." It might have been a "3D action game" with a "first-person perspective." The type: "action" or "shoot 'em up" or "3D shooter." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a 3D action/shooter game, specifically a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." Let's confirm: Neon Vortex is a "3D action game" that was in development for the Sega Saturn, and it was a "shoot 'em up" or "first-person shooter." Let's search memory: I recall reading about Neon Vortex on MobyGames. It might have been a "space shooter" similar to "Raptor: Call of the Shadows" or "Space Harrier"? But let's see: Neon Vortex was a "3D action game" that was planned as a "space shooter" with "neon" graphics. The type: "Action" or "Shooter." So answer: It was a 3D space shooter or first-person shooter. But the question might be expecting: "It was a 3D action/shooter game." So answer: It was a 3D action/shooter game. Also mention that it was planned for Sega Saturn. So answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter (space shooter). Let's produce a succinct answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space‑shooting action game (a first‑person shooter) that Psygnosis was developing for the Sega Saturn." That should answer.

But maybe the question expects: "It was a 3D action game featuring a neon aesthetic." But let's be precise: "Neon Vortex was a 3D action/shooter game, a first-person shooter, intended for the Sega Saturn." That is likely correct.

But let's verify: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a 3D action game, specifically a first‑person shooter." That is the type. So answer: "A 3D first‑person shooter (space shooter) game." Provide context: "It was a 3D action game in development for the Sega Saturn." So answer accordingly.

Let's produce final answer.
