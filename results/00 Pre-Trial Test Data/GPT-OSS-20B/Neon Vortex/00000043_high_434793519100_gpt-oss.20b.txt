Neon Vortex was being built as a **3‑D first‑person shooter**.  
The game was meant to be a cyber‑punk‑style FPS for the PC (and a companion Amiga version), featuring neon‑lit environments and fast‑paced, gun‑fighting action. It never made it past the development stage, so the title was never released.
