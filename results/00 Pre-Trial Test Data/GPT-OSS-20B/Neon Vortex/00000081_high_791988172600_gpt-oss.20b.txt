**Neon Vortex was a first‑person space‑shooting game.**  
It was being developed for the Sega Genesis (32X) as a 3‑D, neon‑themed shooter in which the player piloted a spacecraft through a glowing tunnel‑like environment, firing at enemies and dodging obstacles. The title was cancelled before it reached market.
