Neon Vortex was a **3‑D first‑person shooter** that Psygnosis was developing for the Sega Genesis (and later the Sega Saturn).  The game was intended to feature a bright, neon‑style futuristic setting and could be played with the Genesis light‑gun, but it was cancelled before it ever reached the market.
