**Neon Vortex was a 3‑D space‑shoot‑em‑up.**  
It was being built by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis/32X as a fast‑paced, first‑person shooter in which the player flew a neon‑lit spacecraft through a series of colourful, scrolling “vortices” while blasting enemies and collecting power‑ups. The title was announced in 1994 but was ultimately cancelled when the 32X failed to find a market.
