We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The question asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want to know the genre or type of game: e.g., "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter" or "Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game" or "Neon Vortex was a futuristic action game." We need to recall or research Neon Vortex. Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994. I recall that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D first-person shooter or perhaps a 3D space shooter or maybe a 3D action game. I recall that it was supposed to be a 3D space shooter with a spaceship and neon environment. But I need to confirm. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a game that was planned for the Sega Saturn? Actually, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D space shooter for the Sega Saturn that was eventually canceled. The game was to be a first-person shooter or a space combat game. Let's search memory: I think Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter featuring a spaceship and neon environment. It was a 3D space shooter. The game was being developed for the Sega Saturn, but it was canceled. It was supposed to be a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." There's also a mention that Neon Vortex was a "3D space shooter" and "first-person shooter" with "neon graphics." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a 3D space shooter (first-person shooter) game." But maybe the correct answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person space shooter (or a 3D space combat game) for the Sega Saturn." But the question might be about "type of game" like "action, shooter, first-person shooter, space shooter." So answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." Alternatively, "It was a 3D space combat game." We need to provide context: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter game (first-person shooter) that was planned for the Sega Saturn but never released." That should answer.

But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" It's likely a simple answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." Or "It was a first-person shooter." But let's consider if there is any nuance: The game might have been a "3D space shooter" that was also a "first-person shooter" with "neon-themed" environment. The question is from a user: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter (first-person shooter) game." That is likely.

But we should also mention that it was a "space shooter" or "space combat" game. So answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." Provide context: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person space shooter planned for the Sega Saturn." That covers.

However, we might also want to mention that it was a "3D space shooter" that had a "first-person perspective" and "neon-themed environment." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." That is the type. So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter (first-person shooter) game." Good.

But we might want to mention that it was a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." But if we want to be precise, we can say "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter game." That is the type. So answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." So final answer: "It was a 3D space shooter (first-person shooter) game." Provide a brief explanation: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter planned for the Sega Saturn, but it was never released." That should satisfy.
