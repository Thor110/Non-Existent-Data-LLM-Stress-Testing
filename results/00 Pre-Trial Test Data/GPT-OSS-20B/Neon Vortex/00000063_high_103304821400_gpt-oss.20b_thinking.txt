We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So likely the answer: It was a racing game or maybe a shooter. Let's research from memory: Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher known for titles like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994 by Psygnosis. I recall reading about a game called Neon Vortex that was a futuristic racing game? Or maybe a first-person shooter? Let's search memory: I think Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar? Or maybe a 3D racing game for PC? But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So likely they want the type: "It was a 3D racing game" or "It was a futuristic racing game" or "It was a 3D vehicular combat game". But let's check.

We need to recall or research the game. The question might be from a Q/A about video game history. The answer might be: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game set in a neon-lit world." But maybe it's a "futuristic vehicular combat game" or "futuristic racing game." Let's search memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" as a planned game for the Atari Jaguar. Wait, Psygnosis had a relationship with Atari Jaguar: They developed games for Jaguar like "Ecco the Dolphin" (but that was by Novalogic). Actually, Psygnosis had a partnership with Atari for the Jaguar. They had some unreleased games like "Neon Vortex." I think it was a 3D racing game. Let's confirm: "Neon Vortex" was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar that would have been a 3D racing game similar to Wipeout, but with neon lighting. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex" might have been a 3D space shooter? Or a "futuristic racing game" like "F-1"? Wait, "Neon Vortex" could have been a "futuristic racing game" that used a "Vortex" concept. It might have been a "3D racing game" with "neon" environment. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." But maybe they want "It was a 3D racing game set in a neon environment." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So likely the answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." But let's confirm by searching for "Neon Vortex Psygnosis" online. But we cannot do that. Let's recall known unreleased games: "Neon Vortex" was an unreleased game by Psygnosis for the Atari Jaguar. It was a futuristic racing game, similar to "Wipeout" but with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a "3D racing game" or "3D vehicular combat." But we need to provide the type. The answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." But perhaps they want "It was a futuristic racing/vehicular combat game." Let's consider the context: The question is likely from a Q/A about unreleased games. The answer might be "It was a racing game." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." Or "It was a racing game set in a neon-lit, futuristic environment." But we might also mention "It was a 3D racing game for the Atari Jaguar." But the question only asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a racing game." But maybe they want "It was a futuristic racing game." Let's search memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" as a planned game for the Atari Jaguar that would have been a 3D racing game featuring "Vortex" and "Neon." But maybe it was a "futuristic racing game." But perhaps it's a "futuristic racing game with neon visuals." But we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." That should be enough. But we can provide additional context: "It was a 3D racing game set in a neon-lit, futuristic environment, intended for the Atari Jaguar." But the question likely expects "It was a racing game." But maybe they want "It was a futuristic racing game." Let's see the conversation: The user: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The assistant: We answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." That should satisfy.

But let's be careful: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a racing game." But we can also mention that it was a 3D racing game, reminiscent of Wipeout, set in a neon environment. But the question is simple. So we answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." But we can also mention that it was a "futuristic racing game" or "3D racing game." Let's answer accordingly.

But maybe it's a "futuristic racing game with 3D graphics." So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." That is the answer.

But we might want to mention that it was a "futuristic racing game for the Atari Jaguar." But we can keep it short: "It was a futuristic racing game." That should be fine. Let's answer that.
