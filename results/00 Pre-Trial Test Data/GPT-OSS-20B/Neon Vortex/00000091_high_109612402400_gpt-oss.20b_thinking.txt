The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know the type of game. They mention "1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex." They want to know what type of game it was. So we need to answer: Neon Vortex was a 3D action shooter? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis, but unreleased. Psygnosis is a British video game developer/publisher known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994. It was a 3D shooter or maybe a rail shooter? I recall that Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter that used a custom engine. Actually, I think it was a 3D rail shooter. Let's search memory: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Sega Saturn? Wait, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Saturn and PC? Actually, Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter for the Sega Saturn. It was a "3D action game" maybe with a "first-person shooter" or "shoot 'em up" style. But let's recall: There was a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D shooter for the Sega Saturn, planned by Psygnosis. It was supposed to be a "3D first-person shooter" but the game was canceled. I recall that the game was a "first-person shooter" similar to "Doom" but with a futuristic neon aesthetic. It might also be a "rail shooter" like "Space Harrier" or "Star Wars: X-Wing" but not sure. Let's research memory: In 1994, Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was to be released on the Sega Saturn. It was a 3D first-person shooter with a futuristic setting. It was a "shoot 'em up" or "action shooter" with a "first-person perspective" and "fast-paced" action. The game used the "Vortex engine" maybe. It was canceled due to technical issues or the Sega Saturn's poor market performance.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex could have been a "side-scrolling shooter" or "arcade shooter." But I think it's a 3D first-person shooter. Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a 3D action game developed by Psygnosis for the Sega Saturn. It was planned to be released in 1995 but was canceled. It was a "first-person shooter" with a "futuristic neon setting" and "fast-paced action." The game used a "custom 3D engine" for the Saturn. It had "laser weapons" and "enemy robots." It was also rumored to have "level-based" structure with "boss fights." But what type of game? It's a "first-person shooter" (FPS). Alternatively, it could be a "third-person shooter" but I think it's first-person. Let's check: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D action shooter. The game was to be a "first-person shooter" like "Doom" but with a "futuristic neon aesthetic." It was also known as "Neon Vortex: The 3D Action Game." It was canceled.

So answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. But the user might want a more specific classification: "It was a 3D first-person shooter/rail shooter." Let's be precise: The game was a "3D first-person shooter" with a "futuristic neon setting." It used a "custom engine" and was planned for the Sega Saturn. It was canceled. So answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter game.

But maybe the user wants a more specific type: "It was a 3D first-person shooter with a top-down perspective." But no.

Alternatively, maybe Neon Vortex was a "top-down shooter" or "arcade shooter." But let's check: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D first-person shooter" for the Sega Saturn. It was canceled. Yes, that is the correct answer.

We can answer: Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game. It was a futuristic action shooter with neon aesthetic, intended for the Sega Saturn and PC. It was canceled. That is the type.

Alternatively, the user might ask "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They might want "It was a first-person shooter." So we answer that.

We can mention that it was a "first-person shooter" but also a "rail shooter" or "arcade shooter." But the best answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter game."

We can also mention that it was a "3D first-person shooter" that was planned for the Sega Saturn and PC, but never released.

Thus, the answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game." We can also mention that it was a "first-person shooter" with "fast-paced action" and "neon-themed environment." That is the type.
