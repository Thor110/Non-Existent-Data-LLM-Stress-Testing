**Neon Vortex was a 2‑D side‑scroller – an action‑platformer with beat‑‘em‑up combat elements, set in a neon‑lit cyber‑punk world.**  

The game was being developed for the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) in 1994, but it was ultimately cancelled before release. Its design was meant to combine classic platforming gameplay with a gritty, neon‑bright aesthetic reminiscent of early 90s cyber‑punk titles.
