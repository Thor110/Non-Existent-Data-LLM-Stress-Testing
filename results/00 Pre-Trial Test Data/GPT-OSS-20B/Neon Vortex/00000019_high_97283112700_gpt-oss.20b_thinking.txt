We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to identify the type of game. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the genre, like "shoot 'em up", "first-person shooter", "platformer", "strategy", etc. So we need to know about Neon Vortex. Neon Vortex was a planned Psygnosis game for the 32X or Sega Genesis? It was unreleased, but I think it was a 3D shooter or a racing game. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Sega Genesis or maybe for the 32X. Psygnosis was known for games like Lemmings, Shadow of the Beast, etc. Neon Vortex was a planned 3D game for the Sega Genesis? Let's search memory. Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter that was canceled. Actually, there was a game called Neon Vortex that was a 3D shooter for the Sega Genesis, but it was canceled. There is also a game called Neon Vortex for the 32X that was a 3D racing or a shooter? I'm not entirely sure. Let's recall: There was a game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Genesis that was a 3D shooter, but it was canceled. It was planned to be a 3D space shooter, maybe a "space shooter" or "shoot 'em up". The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter game." But we need to be precise: It was a 3D space shooter. So we should answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter (a space shooter)". But we might need to mention that it was a 3D "shoot 'em up" or "first-person shooter" game. Let's check references: Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter game for the Sega Genesis (32X). It was planned by Psygnosis and was to be a 3D space shooter, like a 3D version of a shooter. It might have been a "3D first-person shooter" or "3D space shooter" game. But what type? The question might be answered by "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (a space shooter)". Or "Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter game." The question might be answered by "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter (first-person)". So answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter." So we can answer that. But let's double-check.

Neon Vortex was a planned game by Psygnosis, originally announced in 1994 for the Sega Genesis and later for the 32X. It was a 3D first-person shooter. It was canceled. It had a futuristic setting. The game was to be similar to the "Space Harrier" or "R-Type" but in 3D. It might have been a "3D space shooter" similar to "Space Harrier" but with 3D. But maybe it's a "3D racing" game? Let's search memory: There was a game called "Neon Vortex" for the 32X that was a "3D racing game" like "Stunt Racer"? But no, that was "Stunt Racer" by Psygnosis. "Neon Vortex" was not that. Let's search memory: The 32X had games like "Fighter's Fury", "Stunt Racer", "The Adventures of Tintin", "Taz-Mania". But "Neon Vortex" was not released. There was a rumor that it was a "3D racing" game. But I think it's a "3D space shooter". Let's confirm by searching memory: Neon Vortex is a 3D space shooter for the Sega Genesis, similar to "Space Harrier" or "R-Type" but in 3D. It was planned to be a 3D "shoot 'em up" game. It was canceled due to the 32X's poor performance. So the answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter." That seems correct.

But let's check the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they might want "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter." The question might be from a trivia about unreleased games. So the answer might be "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter (a first-person shooter)". Let's produce a short answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter." That seems good.

But let's be thorough: The question might be part of a set of "unreleased Psygnosis games" like "Neon Vortex" and "Neon City" etc. The type might be "3D first-person shooter" or "3D shooter". So answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person space shooter." That is the type.

But we might also mention that it was a "3D shooter" or "first-person shooter." So answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter." Let's answer that.

We might also mention that it was a "3D space shooter" or "3D shooter" game. So answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter." That is likely the correct answer.

Thus answer: "It was a 3D first-person space shooter."
