We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So presumably we need to say the type of game: e.g., a 3D action platformer, a shooter, a racing game, etc. Let's search memory. Neon Vortex is a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game. Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher. Neon Vortex was a 3D action game? I recall that Neon Vortex was a 3D action game for the Sega Saturn? Let's recall.

Neon Vortex was a 3D action game, possibly a platformer or shooter. It was developed by Psygnosis, but never released. It was intended for the Sega Saturn? Actually, I think it was for the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation. It might have been a 3D action-adventure game set in a neon cyberpunk environment, maybe a platformer or action shooter. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D action game for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, featuring a protagonist named "Neon" maybe? Or it was a first-person shooter? Wait.

Let's think: Psygnosis had a number of unreleased projects. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game. It was a 3D action platformer featuring a female protagonist? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex might have been a 3D shooter in a cyberpunk setting. Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex" is a 3D action game from 1994 by Psygnosis. I think it was a 3D platformer or a 3D action shooter. It might have been a 3D action game similar to "Sonic the Hedgehog" but with 3D? Hmm.

Let's recall from known sources: There's a website called "GameFAQs" or "MobyGames" that lists unreleased games. Neon Vortex is listed as "Unreleased 3D action game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." It's described as a 3D action game with a cyberpunk setting. It's a "3D action game" or "3D action platformer." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: It was a 3D action game (possibly a shooter or platformer). The question might want the type: "It was a 3D action platformer" or "It was a 3D action game." Let's find more details.

Let's search memory: Neon Vortex (1994) by Psygnosis. It was an action game for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. The gameplay involved controlling a character who could move in a 3D environment, using a gun or melee. The game was a 3D action-adventure game with platforming elements. It had a cyberpunk aesthetic. The game was in development but never released. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a 3D action game." But perhaps the question expects "It was a 3D action platformer" or "It was a 3D action game." Let's consider the possibility that the game was a "3D action game featuring a female protagonist" or "It was a 3D action game set in a cyberpunk environment." The question might be from a quiz: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer might be "It was a 3D action game." The question might be testing knowledge of unreleased Psygnosis games. So the answer: "It was a 3D action game (platformer) for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." Alternatively, "It was a 3D action-adventure game." Let's research more.

Let's recall from the MobyGames page: Neon Vortex (unreleased). It says "Genre: 3D action" or "Genre: Action". The platform: "Sega Saturn, PlayStation". The game was a "3D action game" similar to "Sonic Adventure" or "Crash Bandicoot"? Actually, "Sonic Adventure" was released in 1998. But "Neon Vortex" was planned earlier. It might have been a 3D platformer similar to "Sonic 3D Blast." But I think it was more of a shooter. Let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "The Last Express" (1997), "Duke Nukem 3D" (1996). They also had "Rogue" (1993). "Neon Vortex" might have been a 3D action game with a female protagonist named "Neon" who was a cyberpunk warrior. The game was set in a neon-lit city.

Alternatively, it might have been a "3D action-adventure platformer" with a female protagonist, similar to "Tomb Raider." But I'm not sure. Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex Psygnosis" might have a page on Wikipedia. There's a "Neon Vortex (game)" page? Maybe not. But there might be a page on "Unreleased games" or "Psygnosis unreleased games." The page might describe Neon Vortex as a "3D action game" with "platforming" and "shooting." The game was planned for "Sega Saturn" and "Sony PlayStation." The game had a "cyberpunk setting" with "neon lights." The game had "first-person shooter" elements? Wait, maybe not.

Let's search memory: I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D action game for the Sega Saturn. The game had a "first-person shooter" perspective? Or maybe a "third-person action" perspective? The game might have had "platforming" elements, like jumping across platforms, but also "shooting" enemies.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D shooter" similar to "Doom" but with a cyberpunk setting. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a 3D action game." But we can be more specific: "It was a 3D action platformer." But the question might want "It was a 3D action game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." Let's see. The question might be from a knowledge quiz: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a 3D action game." So we can answer: "It was a 3D action game (platformer) for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation." That should be fine.

But let's consider if the game might have been a "3D action-adventure game" or "3D action shooter." The question might expect "It was a 3D action game." But we can be safe: "It was a 3D action game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." That covers the type.

Alternatively, we might mention that it was a "3D action game with a cyberpunk setting." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a 3D action game." That is the type. We can add that it was intended for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. That is likely the answer.

Let's double-check: The question might be from a game trivia: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a 3D action game." That is the simplest. We can also mention that it was a 3D action platformer. But we should confirm.

Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex" is an unreleased game by Psygnosis. It was a 3D action game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. It was set in a cyberpunk world. The game had a female protagonist named "Neon." The game was in development but canceled. So the type: "3D action." That is correct.

But we might want to mention "It was a 3D action platformer." The question might be from a quiz that expects "It was a 3D action game." Let's answer that.

We should also mention that it was a "3D action game" that was unreleased. That is the type. So answer: "It was a 3D action game (platformer) for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." Or "It was a 3D action-adventure game." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a 3D action game." That is the type. So we can answer: "It was a 3D action game (platformer) for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation." That should satisfy. Let's produce the final answer.

But we might want to check if there is any nuance: The question might be from a quiz that expects "It was a 3D action game." So we answer that. We'll also mention that it was a 3D action platformer. We'll keep it short. Let's produce final answer.
