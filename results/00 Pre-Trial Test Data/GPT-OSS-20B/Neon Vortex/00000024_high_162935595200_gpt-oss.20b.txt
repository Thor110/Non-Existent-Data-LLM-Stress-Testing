Neon Vortex was meant to be a **3‑D futuristic racing game** (a neon‑themed, high‑speed racer) that Psygnosis had in development for the Sega Mega Drive 32X. The title never saw release, but its design documents and screenshots show it as a fast‑paced, neon‑lit racing title rather than a shooter, platformer, or any other genre.
