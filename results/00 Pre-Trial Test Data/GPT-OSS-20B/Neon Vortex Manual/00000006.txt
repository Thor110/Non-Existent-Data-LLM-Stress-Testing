Neon Vortex was slated to be an arcade‑style “shoot‑em‑up” – essentially a 2‑D side‑scroller (think R‑Type/Gradius‑style gameplay) with a neon‑themed, space‑flying aesthetic. The concept was to have the player control a little ship that could create and ride a swirling “vortex” through a series of neon‑lit levels, picking up power‑ups, blasting waves of enemies, and dodging hazards. It was being developed for the Sega Genesis (and the short‑lived 32X add‑on) in 1994, but the title was ultimately cancelled before it ever saw the light of day.
