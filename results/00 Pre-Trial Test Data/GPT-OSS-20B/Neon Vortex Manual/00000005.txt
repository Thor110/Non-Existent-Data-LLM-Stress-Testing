Neon Vortex was a futuristic 3‑D space‑shooter (a “shoot‑em‑up”) that Psygnosis was developing in 1994.

It was intended for the Amiga/PC and used a neon‑themed, vortex‑like environment where the player piloted a spacecraft, blasting enemies and collecting power‑ups. The title was cancelled before it ever reached the market.
