Neon Vortex was a 3‑D first‑person shooter.

The game was being built by Psygnosis in 1994 for the 3DO console and was billed as an arcade‑style, neon‑lit cyber‑punk shooter. It was intended to be an action‑packed FPS with a futuristic aesthetic, but the project was shelved when the 3DO failed to gain traction.
