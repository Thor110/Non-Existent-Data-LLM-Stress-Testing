I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this is a fictional or non-existent game. If you could provide more context or clarify what you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further.

However, I did find information on a different game called Neon Vortex, which was released in 1994 by Psygnosis for the Sega CD. It's a psychedelic platformer that takes place in a futuristic world with neon-lit environments and futuristic characters. If this is not the same game you were thinking of, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!
