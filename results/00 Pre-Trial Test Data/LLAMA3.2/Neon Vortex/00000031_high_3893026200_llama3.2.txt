I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, and all mentions of it are anecdotal or rumors.

However, I did find that Neon Vortex is an actual game developed by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1998 for the PlayStation. It's a futuristic racing game with 3D graphics, and it received generally positive reviews at the time of its release.
