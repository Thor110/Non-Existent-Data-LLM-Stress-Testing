I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released or unreleased in 1994. However, I did find that there is an unreleased PlayStation prototype called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis in the mid-1990s. It was a 3D platformer with a futuristic setting and unique gameplay mechanics.

If you have any more information about this game or would like to know more about its development, I'd be happy to try and help!
