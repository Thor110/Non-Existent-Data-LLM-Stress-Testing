I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find that there was a game called "Neon Vortex" released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 by Psygnosis, but it's not clear if this is the same game you're referring to.

If you have any more information or clarification about the game, I'd be happy to try and help further.
