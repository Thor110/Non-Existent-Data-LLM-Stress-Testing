I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never completed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot or a description of its gameplay, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're looking for information on Psygnosis games, I'd be happy to try and assist you with that as well!
