I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released in 1994 or otherwise. It's possible that it was an internal project, prototype, or canceled development, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for their work on several notable titles, including Wipeout, Destruction Derby, and Jet Set Radio. However, without more information, I couldn't determine the nature of "Neon Vortex" or whether it was indeed a game developed by Psygnosis.

If you have any additional details or context about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
