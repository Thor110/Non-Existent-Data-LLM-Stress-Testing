I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially released or announced, or it may be a prototype or concept that was never fully developed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or what it was supposed to be like, I might be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you know who the developer is (e.g., Psygnosis, etc.), I can try to dig up more information on the game.
