I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced, or that it was a prototype or concept that was not completed.

If you have any more information about this game, such as a screenshot, box art, or a brief description, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the studio and its notable titles.
