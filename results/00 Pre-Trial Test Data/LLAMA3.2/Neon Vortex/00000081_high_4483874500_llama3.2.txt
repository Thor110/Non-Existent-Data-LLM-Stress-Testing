I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game never existed or was not publicly announced. If you have more context or details about the game, I may be able to help you further.

However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find more information:

* Check online databases such as MobyGames, GameFAQs, or IMDb to see if they have any information on a game with this title.
* Look for retro gaming forums or communities to see if anyone remembers or discusses the game.
* Try searching for videos or reviews of the game on YouTube or other video platforms.

If you have more information about the game, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
