I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a game that is not well-documented or easily accessible.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot, box art, or a brief description of its gameplay, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis and their games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the company and their output during the 1990s.
