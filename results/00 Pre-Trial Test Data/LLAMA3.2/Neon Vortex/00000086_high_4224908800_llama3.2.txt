Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" that was released or even announced in 1994. It's possible that it was an internal prototype or a cancelled project, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for their work on various platforms, including the PlayStation and Saturn consoles. Some of their notable titles include Wipeout, Lemmings, and Syphon Filter.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as screenshots or gameplay mechanics, I might be able to help you identify it as a specific game.
