I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a misremembered or incorrect title.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a box art image or a gameplay concept, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're thinking of a different game, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!
