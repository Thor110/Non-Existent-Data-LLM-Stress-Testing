I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this game was never officially released, or it may be a prototype or a concept that was never completed.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. They were known for developing games such as "Wipeout," "Alien Breed," and "Headhunter."

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I may be able to help you further.
