I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a lost or forgotten title.

However, I did find some information on a 1994 game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. The game is a futuristic racing simulator with a focus on high-speed driving and aerial combat.

If this isn't the same game you were referring to, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you find more information about it.
