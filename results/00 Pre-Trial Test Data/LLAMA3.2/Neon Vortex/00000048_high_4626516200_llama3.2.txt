I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this is a rare or obscure game, or it may not exist at all.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher, known for creating several iconic games in the 1990s, such as Wipeout, Jet Set Radio, and Syphon Filter. However, I couldn't find any information on a game called "Neon Vortex" that matches this description.

If you have any more information about this game, or if you're thinking of a different game with a similar title, please let me know and I'll try to help further!
