I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a fictional or non-existent game.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other details, I'd be happy to try and help you identify what type of game it might have been.
