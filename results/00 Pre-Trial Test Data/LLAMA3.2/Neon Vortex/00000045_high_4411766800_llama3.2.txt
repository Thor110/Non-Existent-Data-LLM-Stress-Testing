I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a fan-made concept rather than an actual game.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for their work on various titles such as Wipeout, Jet Set Radio, and Syphon Filter. They were active in the 1990s and early 2000s, but I couldn't find any information on a game called "Neon Vortex" associated with them.

If you have any more information or context about Neon Vortex, such as concept art or developer statements, I may be able to help you further.
