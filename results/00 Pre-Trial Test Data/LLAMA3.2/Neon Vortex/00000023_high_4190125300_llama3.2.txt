I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially released or that it was never publicly announced.

However, I did find some information on a game called "Neon Vortex" that was announced by Psygnosis in 1993 for the Amiga and Atari ST platforms. The game was supposed to be a futuristic racing game with 3D graphics, but it seems that development was cancelled or delayed before its release.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
