I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a fictional or conceptual title.

However, I can suggest some possible sources where you might be able to find more information about this game:

1. Online forums and communities dedicated to retro gaming and Psygnosis games.
2. Game databases and wikis, such as MobyGames or IGN's Game Database.
3. Retro gaming websites and blogs that specialize in reviewing and discussing classic games.

If you have any more information or context about Neon Vortex, I may be able to help you further.
