I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it's a rare or obscure game, or maybe it was never officially released.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating games like WipEout, Jet Set Radio, and Syphon Filter. However, I couldn't find any records of a game called "Neon Vortex" associated with Psygnosis.

If you have more information about the game, such as its genre or what it was supposed to be, I might be able to help you better.
