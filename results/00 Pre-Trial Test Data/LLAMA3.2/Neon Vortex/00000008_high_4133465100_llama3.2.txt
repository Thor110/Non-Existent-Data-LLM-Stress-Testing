I couldn't find any information on a unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" from 1994. It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis, or it may be a fictional or conceptual project.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for their work on various platforms, including the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC. Some of their notable titles include "WipEout", "Syphon Filter", and "TimeSplitters".

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex or Psygnosis, I may be able to help you better.
