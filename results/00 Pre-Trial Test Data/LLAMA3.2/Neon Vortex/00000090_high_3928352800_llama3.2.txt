I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced, or it may be a fictional or concept game.

If you have any more information about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other details, I'd be happy to try and help you further. Alternatively, if you're looking for information on Psygnosis games that were actually released, I'd be happy to provide some recommendations!
