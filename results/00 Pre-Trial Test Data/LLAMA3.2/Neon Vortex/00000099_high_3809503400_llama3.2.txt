I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it's a relatively obscure or unknown game, or maybe it was never officially released at all.

If you have any more details or context about the game, I'd be happy to try and help you further. Alternatively, if you're interested in discussing games or Psygnosis, I'd be happy to chat with you about that too!
