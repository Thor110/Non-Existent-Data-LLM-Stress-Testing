Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was a prototype or a cancelled project, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active in the late 1980s to early 2000s. They were known for developing several iconic games, including Wipeout, Lemmings, and Syphon Filter. However, without more information or context, it's difficult to determine what type of game "Neon Vortex" might have been.

If you have any additional information about this game, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
