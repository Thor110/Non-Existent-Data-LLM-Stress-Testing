I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was a prototype or an early version of a game that was never completed or released.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating many iconic games in the 90s, such as Wipeout, Syphon Filter, and Crash Bandicoot. If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you find out what type of game it might have been.
