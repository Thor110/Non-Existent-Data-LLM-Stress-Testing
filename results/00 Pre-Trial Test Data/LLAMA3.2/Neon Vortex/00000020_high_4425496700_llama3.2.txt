I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" that was released or unreleased in 1994. It's possible that this is a fictional or non-existent game.

However, I did find information on a game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis, but it was released in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console. The game was a futuristic racing simulation where players could choose from various vehicles and compete in high-speed races through various levels set in different environments.

If you have any more information about the Neon Vortex game you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further!
