I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially released or was cancelled, but I couldn't find any credible sources confirming its existence.

However, I did find some information on a 1987 game called "Vortex" developed by Psygnosis, which is an action-adventure game for the Amiga and Atari ST. Could this be the game you're thinking of?
