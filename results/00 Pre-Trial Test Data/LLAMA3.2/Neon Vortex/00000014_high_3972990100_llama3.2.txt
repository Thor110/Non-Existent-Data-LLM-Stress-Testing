I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never fully developed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as screenshots or gameplay details, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis and their games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the company and its notable titles.
