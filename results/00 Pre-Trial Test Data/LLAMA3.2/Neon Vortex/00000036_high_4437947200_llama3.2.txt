I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never completed.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the 1980s to the early 2000s. They were known for developing and publishing several notable games, including "Wipeout", "Syphon Filter", and "Disaster". However, I couldn't find any information on a game called "Neon Vortex" associated with Psygnosis.

If you have any more information or context about the game, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
