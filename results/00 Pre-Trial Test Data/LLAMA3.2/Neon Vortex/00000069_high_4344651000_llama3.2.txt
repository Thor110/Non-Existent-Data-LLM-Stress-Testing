I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" that was released in 1994 or unreleased. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different game, or that the game is a myth or rumor.

However, I did find information on a game called "Neon Vortex: Rebirth", which was announced by Psygnosis in 2000, but it was later cancelled due to financial issues. The game was planned as a 3D action-adventure game, and it would have featured a unique blend of gameplay mechanics.

If you're interested in learning more about the game, I can try to dig up some more information for you!
