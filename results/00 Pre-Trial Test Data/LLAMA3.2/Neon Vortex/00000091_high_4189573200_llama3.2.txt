I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or that it was a prototype or a cancelled project.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the 1980s to the early 2000s. They were known for developing and publishing various games across multiple platforms, including the Amiga, PC, and console systems.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as screenshots or a brief description of its gameplay, I may be able to help you identify it.
