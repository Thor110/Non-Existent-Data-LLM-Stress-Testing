I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a game that is no longer well-known or documented.

If you have any more information about the game, such as screenshots or a brief description, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis and their games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the company and their portfolio of titles.
