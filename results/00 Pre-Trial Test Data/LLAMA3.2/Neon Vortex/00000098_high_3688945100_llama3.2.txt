I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was a prototype or a canceled project, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence. If you have more information about the game, such as artwork, screenshots, or a brief description, I might be able to help you identify what type of game it could have been.
