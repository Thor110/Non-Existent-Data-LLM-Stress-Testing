I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced, and I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find more information about the game:

1. Check online archives: Websites like MobyGames, Wikipedia, or GameFAQs often have databases of unreleased games, cancelled titles, or retro games. You can try searching for "Neon Vortex" on these websites to see if they have any information.
2. Look for fan communities: Fan-made forums, social media groups, or online communities dedicated to Psygnosis or retro gaming might have discussions about Neon Vortex.
3. Contact Psygnosis: If you're interested in learning more about the game, you can try reaching out to Psygnosis directly (or its successors) to inquire about the game's status.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as a rough idea of what the game might have looked like or any other details, I'd be happy to help you investigate further!
