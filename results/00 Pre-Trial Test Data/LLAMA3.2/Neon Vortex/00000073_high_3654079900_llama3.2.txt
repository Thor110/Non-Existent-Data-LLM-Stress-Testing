I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a very rare or obscure game that I couldn't access.

If you have more information about this game, such as its genre, platform, or any other details, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
