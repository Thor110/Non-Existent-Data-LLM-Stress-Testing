I couldn't find any information on a unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" from 1994. It's possible that it was a concept or prototype that was never officially announced or released.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher, known for creating games such as Wipeout and Syphon Filter. If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
