I couldn't find any information on a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released in 1994 or otherwise. It's possible that it was a conceptual project, prototype, or never officially announced and released.

However, I did find some information on a 1994 game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis, which is actually a racing game for the Sega Saturn console. If you're interested in learning more about this game, feel free to ask!
