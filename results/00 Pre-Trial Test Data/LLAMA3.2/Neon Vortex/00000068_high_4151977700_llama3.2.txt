I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or that it was a prototype or concept that was never completed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other details, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the company and their notable titles.
