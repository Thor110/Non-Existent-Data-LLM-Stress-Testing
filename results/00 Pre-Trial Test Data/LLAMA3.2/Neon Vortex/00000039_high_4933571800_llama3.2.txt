I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that this game is not well-known or was never officially released.

However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find more information about the game:

1. Check online databases: Websites like MobyGames, GameFAQs, and Wikipedia may have entries on unreleased games, including Neon Vortex.
2. Look for retro gaming communities: Online forums and social media groups dedicated to retro gaming might have discussions or threads about Neon Vortex.
3. Search for Psygnosis games: If you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis, a UK-based game developer and publisher, I can suggest some of their notable titles, such as Wipeout, Shadow of the Beast, or Lemmings.

If you have any additional information or context about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
