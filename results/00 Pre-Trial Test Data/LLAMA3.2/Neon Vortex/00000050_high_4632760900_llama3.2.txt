I couldn't find any information on a unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" from 1994. It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a misremembered or incorrect title.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating games such as Wipeout, Lemmings, and Air Combat. They were acquired by Sony in 1993, but I couldn't find any information on a specific game called "Neon Vortex" from their development library or any other source.

If you have any more information about this game, such as box art, screenshots, or a description of the gameplay mechanics, I may be able to help you identify it.
