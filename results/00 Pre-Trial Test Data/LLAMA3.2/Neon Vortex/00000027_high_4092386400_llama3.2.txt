I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was not widely known.

If you have any more information about the game, such as box art or screenshots, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I can suggest some of their notable titles, such as WipEout, Lemmings, or Alien vs. Predator.
