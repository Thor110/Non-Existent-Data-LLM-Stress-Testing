I couldn't find any information on a unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" from 1994. It's possible that you may be thinking of a different game or have incorrect information.

However, I did find information on a game called "Neon Vortex" which was released in 2001 by Psygnosis for the PlayStation 2. The game is an action-adventure title that features fast-paced combat and exploration.
