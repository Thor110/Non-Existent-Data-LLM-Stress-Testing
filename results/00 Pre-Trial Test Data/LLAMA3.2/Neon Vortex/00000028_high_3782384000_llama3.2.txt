I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was never officially announced or released, or that it was a prototype or cancelled project.

If you have any more details about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other relevant information, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it might have been.
