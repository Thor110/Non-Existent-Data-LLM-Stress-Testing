I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game is a mythical or fictional title, or it may be a game that was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating games such as Wipeout, Jet Set Radio, and Space Station Silicon Valley. If you have any more information about this game, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
