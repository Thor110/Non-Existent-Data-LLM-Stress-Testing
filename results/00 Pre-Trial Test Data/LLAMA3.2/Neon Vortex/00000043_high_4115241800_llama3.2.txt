I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced, and I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

If you have more information about the game, such as gameplay mechanics, genre, or development team, I might be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I can provide information on some of their notable titles, such as Wipeout, Lemmings, or Syphon Filter.
