I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never fully developed.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the 1980s to the early 2000s. They were known for developing several iconic games, including Wipeout and TimeSplitters. However, I couldn't find any information on a game called "Neon Vortex" associated with Psygnosis.

If you have any more information or clarification about this game, I'd be happy to try and help further!
