I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a lost or cancelled project.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as its supposed genre, gameplay mechanics, or artwork, I'd be happy to try and help you investigate further.
