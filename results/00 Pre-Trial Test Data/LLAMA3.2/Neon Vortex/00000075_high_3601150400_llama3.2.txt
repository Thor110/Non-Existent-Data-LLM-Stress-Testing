I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never fully developed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot, trailer, or any other details, I may be able to help you identify it.
