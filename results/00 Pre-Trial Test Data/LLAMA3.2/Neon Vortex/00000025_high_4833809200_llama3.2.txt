Unfortunately, I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it's a rare or obscure game that hasn't been well-documented online.

However, I can suggest some options to help you learn more about the game:

1. Check online databases: Websites like MobyGames, GameFAQs, or Giant Bomb might have information on the game.
2. Look for retro gaming communities: Online forums, social media groups, or specialized retro gaming websites may have discussions or threads about the game.
3. Search for fan-made content: You can try searching for fan-made content, such as concept art, screenshots, or reviews, which might provide more information about the game.

If you have any more specific details about the game, like its genre, platform, or any notable features, I'd be happy to try and help you further!
