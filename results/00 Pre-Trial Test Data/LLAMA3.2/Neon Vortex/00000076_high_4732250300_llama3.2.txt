I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never fully developed.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the 1980s to the early 2000s. They were known for developing games such as Wipeout, Syphon Filter, and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. However, I couldn't find any information on a game called "Neon Vortex" associated with Psygnosis.

If you have any more information about the game, such as artwork or screenshots, it may be possible to identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about classic games or retro gaming, I'd be happy to chat with you about those topics!
