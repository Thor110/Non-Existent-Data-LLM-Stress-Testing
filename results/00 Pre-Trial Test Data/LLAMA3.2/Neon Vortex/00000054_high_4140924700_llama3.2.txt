I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially released or was in development hell, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

However, I can tell you that Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating some iconic titles such as Wipeout, Lemmings, and Syphon Filter. If you have any more information about the game or its development, I might be able to help you further!
