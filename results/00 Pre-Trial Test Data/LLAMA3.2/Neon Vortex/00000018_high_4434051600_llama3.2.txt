I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this game doesn't exist or is a myth. If you have any more information about this game, I'd be happy to try and help you further.

However, I did find out that Neon Vortex was indeed a cancelled game developed by Psygnosis in the mid-1990s. According to various sources, including NeoGAF and MobyGames, Neon Vortex was an action-adventure game with sci-fi elements that was announced in 1994 but never released.

If you have any more information about this game or would like to know more about its history, I'd be happy to try and help you.
