I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that the game never existed or was cancelled before it could be released. If you have any more information about this game, I'd be happy to try and help you further.

However, I did find out that Psygnosis was a British video game developer that was active from 1987 to 2001, and they were known for creating several iconic games such as Wipeout, Jet Set Radio, and Syphon Filter.
