I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never fully developed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a trailer, screenshots, or a brief description, I might be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the company and its notable titles.
