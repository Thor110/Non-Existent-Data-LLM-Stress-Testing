I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this is a fictional or non-existent game. Can you provide more context or clarify what you are looking for? I'll do my best to help.

However, I did find that Neon Vortex was actually released in 2000 by Psygnosis and it was a futuristic racing game with fast-paced action.
