I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially released or documented, or it may be a fictional or hypothetical title.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating games such as Wipeout, Future Wars, and Lemmings, among others. If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I'd be happy to try and help you further.
