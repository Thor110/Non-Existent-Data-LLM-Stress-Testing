I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find that there is a game called "Neon Vortex" released in 2013 for PC and PlayStation Network, developed by Cyber Trooper. It's an action-adventure game with sci-fi elements.

If you're thinking of a different game, please provide more context or details about the game you're looking for, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other relevant information that might help identify it.
