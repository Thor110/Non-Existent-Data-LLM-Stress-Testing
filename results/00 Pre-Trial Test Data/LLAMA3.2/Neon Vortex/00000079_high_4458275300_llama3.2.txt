I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis, and therefore, there is no existing information about it.

However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find more information about the game. You can try searching online archives, gaming forums, or websites dedicated to retro games and developers. Additionally, you can also check out websites like MobyGames, IGN, or GameFAQs, which provide extensive databases of classic video games and their developers.

If you have any more information or details about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other relevant characteristics, I may be able to help you identify it.
