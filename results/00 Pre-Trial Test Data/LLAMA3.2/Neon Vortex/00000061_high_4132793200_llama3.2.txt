I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a prototype or concept that was never completed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot, box art, or any other details, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis and their games, I'd be happy to chat with you about that topic!
