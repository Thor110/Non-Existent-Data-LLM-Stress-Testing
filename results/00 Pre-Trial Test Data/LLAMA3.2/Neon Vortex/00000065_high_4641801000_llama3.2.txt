I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that the game was never officially announced or released, or it may be a fictional game.

However, I did find information on a different game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis in the early 1990s. The game was a futuristic racing game that was released for the Sega Saturn console in Japan and Europe in 1993-1994. It's possible that this is the game you were thinking of, but I couldn't confirm if it was indeed unreleased or if it had any planned features that were never implemented.

If you have any more information about the game "Neon Vortex" you're referring to, I may be able to help you better.
