I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that it was never officially announced or released, or that it was only shared internally within the development team.

If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, such as a prototype or a concept art, I might be able to help you identify the type of game it was intended to be. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I can try to provide some general information on their titles and genres.

However, if you're looking for information on Neon Vortex specifically, I'd need more context or details to help me narrow down the search.
