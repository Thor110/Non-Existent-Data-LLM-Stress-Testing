I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this is a rare or obscure game, or it may not exist at all.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher that was active from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. They were known for creating games such as Wipeout, Alien vs. Predator, and Lemmings. However, I couldn't find any records of a game called "Neon Vortex" being released or developed by Psygnosis.

If you have any more information about this game, such as a screenshot or a brief description, I may be able to help you identify it.
