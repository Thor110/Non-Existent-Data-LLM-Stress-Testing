I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that it was a prototype or concept art that never made it to market, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence.

However, I did find some information on a PlayStation game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis and released in 1997. It was a futuristic racing game with isometric graphics and a focus on high-speed action. Could this be the game you were thinking of?
