I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially released or announced by Psygnosis, or it may be a fan-made title with no official backing. Can you provide more context or details about the game? I'd be happy to try and help you find more information.
