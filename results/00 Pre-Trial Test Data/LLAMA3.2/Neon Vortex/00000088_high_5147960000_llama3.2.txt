I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that it's a rare or obscure game that isn't well-documented online.

However, I can suggest some alternatives to help you find more information about this game:

1. Check online databases: Websites like MobyGames, GameFAQs, and Killer List of Videogames may have information on the game.
2. Look for retro gaming communities: Online forums and social media groups dedicated to retro gaming might have enthusiasts who are knowledgeable about this game.
3. Search for developer information: Psygnosis was a British video game developer, and their games were often published by other companies like Sony Computer Entertainment or Sega. You can try searching for information on the developer's website, social media profiles, or online archives.

If you have any more details or clues about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or release date (even if it was never released), I'd be happy to help you investigate further!
