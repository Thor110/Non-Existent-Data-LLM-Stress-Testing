I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that the game was never officially released or was cancelled before its completion.

If you have any more information about the game, such as its genre or gameplay mechanics, I may be able to help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about unreleased games or Psygnosis' history, I'd be happy to try and provide some general information on those topics.
