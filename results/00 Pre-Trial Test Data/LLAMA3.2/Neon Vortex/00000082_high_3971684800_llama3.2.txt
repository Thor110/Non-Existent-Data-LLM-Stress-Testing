I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this is a relatively obscure or unknown game, and I may not have access to enough data about it.

If you have more information about the game, such as its genre, platform, or any other details, I'd be happy to try and help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games or the history of the company, I'd be happy to chat with you about that!
