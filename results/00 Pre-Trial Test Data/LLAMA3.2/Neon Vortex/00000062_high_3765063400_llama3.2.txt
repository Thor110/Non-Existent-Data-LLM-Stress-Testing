I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was never officially released or was simply a prototype that was not finished.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher, and they were known for creating games such as Wipeout, Syphon Filter, and Lemmings. If you have any more information about the game, I may be able to help you further.
