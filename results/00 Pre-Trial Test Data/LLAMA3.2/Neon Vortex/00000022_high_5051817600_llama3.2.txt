I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game doesn't exist or is not well-known. If you could provide more context or details about the game, I may be able to help you better.

However, I can suggest some options to find more information about the game:

1. Check online databases: Websites like MobyGames, Giant Bomb, or GameFAQs may have information on unreleased games or games that were never officially released.
2. Search for retro gaming communities: Online forums or social media groups dedicated to retro gaming might have discussions or threads about Neon Vortex.
3. Look for rare game collections: Some game collectors or enthusiasts might have information or copies of the game, which could be shared online.

If you have any more details about Neon Vortex, I'll do my best to help you find more information about it.
