I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was never actually released or announced, or that it was a prototype or concept that was never developed into a final product.

If you have any more information about the game, such as screenshots or gameplay details, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the studio and its notable titles.
