I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game never existed or was not officially announced by Psygnosis.

However, I did find some information on the Psygnosis game "Neon Vortex" being an experimental game developed for the PlayStation. The game was a 3D platformer with a unique blend of sci-fi and fantasy elements, and it featured a distinctive art style and sound design. Unfortunately, the game was never released due to technical issues and other reasons.

If you have any more information or clarification about the Neon Vortex game, I'd be happy to try and help further!
