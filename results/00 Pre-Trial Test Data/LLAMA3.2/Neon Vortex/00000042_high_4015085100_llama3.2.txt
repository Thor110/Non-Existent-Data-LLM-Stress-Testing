I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that this is a relatively unknown or obscure game, or it may be a concept that was never fully developed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as its genre, gameplay mechanics, or any other details you might remember, I'd be happy to try and help you identify it. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis games or their history, I'd be happy to provide some general information on the topic.
