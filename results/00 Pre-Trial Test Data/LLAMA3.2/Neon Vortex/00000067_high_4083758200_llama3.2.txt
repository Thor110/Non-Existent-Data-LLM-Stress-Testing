I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game doesn't exist or is not well-documented.

However, I did find some information on a 1994 game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. The game was an isometric action-adventure game for the PlayStation console.

If you have any more information or clarification about the game you're referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further!
