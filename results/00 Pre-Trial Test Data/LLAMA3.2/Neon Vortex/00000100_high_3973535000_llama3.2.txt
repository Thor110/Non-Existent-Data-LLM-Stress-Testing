I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that it was never officially announced or released, or that it was a prototype or concept that was never completed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as screenshots or gameplay details, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was. Alternatively, if you're interested in learning more about Psygnosis or their games, I'd be happy to try and assist you with that!
