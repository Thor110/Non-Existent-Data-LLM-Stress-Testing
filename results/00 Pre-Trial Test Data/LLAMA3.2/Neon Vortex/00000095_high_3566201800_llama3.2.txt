I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it was a concept or prototype that was never officially released or publicly announced. If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot or a brief description, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was.
