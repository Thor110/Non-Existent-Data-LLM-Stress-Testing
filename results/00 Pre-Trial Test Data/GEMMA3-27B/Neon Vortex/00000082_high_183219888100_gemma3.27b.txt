Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what it was supposed to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinctly cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city controlled by a powerful corporation. Players would take on the role of a law enforcer tasked with taking down criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the environment in live-action video sequences.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was designed to be highly interactive. The game aimed to create a branching narrative based on player choices and shooting accuracy. Your actions would influence the story and lead to different outcomes.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* fairly late in development. The primary reason was the rising cost of FMV production and concerns about the quality of the live-action footage. The game was deemed too expensive to complete to a satisfactory standard, especially with the PlayStation's limited storage capacity at the time.

**Legacy:**

Despite never being released, *Neon Vortex* has become a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, offering a glimpse into what could have been a groundbreaking title. It's often cited as an example of an ambitious project that fell victim to technological limitations and budgetary constraints.
