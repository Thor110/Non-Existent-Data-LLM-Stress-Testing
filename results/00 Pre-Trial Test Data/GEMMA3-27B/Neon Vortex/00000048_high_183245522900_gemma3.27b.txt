Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **3D puzzle-action game** with a strong emphasis on fast-paced gameplay and a unique visual style.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a small ship navigating through abstract, neon-lit mazes. The goal was to collect energy orbs while avoiding obstacles and enemies. It was described as a blend of *Wipeout* (another Psygnosis title) and a puzzle game.
*   **Visuals:** Neon Vortex was notable for its vibrant, vector-graphics-inspired visuals. The environments were minimalist and futuristic, with a focus on bright colors and geometric shapes. It aimed for a visually striking and immersive experience.
*   **Technology:** It was developed using Psygnosis' proprietary 3D engine, pushing the limits of the Amiga 1200 hardware.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was nearly complete when Psygnosis decided to cancel it. The reasons were a combination of factors, including the Amiga 1200's declining market share, concerns about the game's complexity, and Psygnosis's shift in focus towards PlayStation development.

While never officially released, a playable demo leaked online in the early 2000s, allowing fans to experience the game. It's become a cult classic among Amiga enthusiasts, praised for its innovative gameplay and striking visuals.
