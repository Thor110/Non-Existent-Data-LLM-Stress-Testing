Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a groundbreaking, fully 3D racing game for the PlayStation, but it was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's what we know about its genre and gameplay:

*   **Genre:** It's best described as a **3D futuristic racing game**, similar in concept to *Wipeout* or *F-Zero*. However, *Neon Vortex* was aiming for a much more realistic and immersive experience.
*   **Gameplay:** Unlike the arcade-style speed of *Wipeout*, *Neon Vortex* focused on **physics-based handling** and a more simulation-like driving model. Players would pilot advanced hovercrafts through complex, twisting courses. 
*   **Unique Features:**
    *   **Force Feedback:** It was intended to make extensive use of the PlayStation's DualShock controller's force feedback features to simulate the feeling of speed and G-forces.
    *   **Dynamic Lighting:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the PlayStation's hardware to its limits with advanced dynamic lighting effects, creating a visually striking and atmospheric experience.
    *   **Detailed Environments:** The courses were designed to be highly detailed and immersive, with a focus on creating a sense of speed and depth.

**Why was it cancelled?**

The primary reason for the cancellation was that it was deemed too ambitious for the PlayStation's hardware at the time. The game was struggling to maintain a stable frame rate, and Psygnosis felt it wouldn't be able to deliver a polished and enjoyable experience. They ultimately decided to focus on *Wipeout*, which was considered a more achievable project.

While never released, footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been a truly innovative racing game. It remains a legendary "lost" title in gaming history.
