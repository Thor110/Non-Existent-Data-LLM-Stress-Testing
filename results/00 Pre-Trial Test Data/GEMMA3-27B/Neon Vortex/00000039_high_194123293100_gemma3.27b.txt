Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a fully 3D, fast-paced, arcade-style racing game for the PlayStation. However, it was cancelled in 1994 and never officially released.

Here's a breakdown of the game type and what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Futuristic Racing / Combat Racing. It was heavily inspired by games like *Wipeout* and *F-Zero*, but with a darker, more cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would pilot futuristic hovercrafts around twisting, neon-lit tracks. The focus was on high speed, drifting, and weapon-based combat. Players could pick up power-ups to attack opponents and defend themselves.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its early use of fully 3D polygon graphics on the PlayStation. It aimed for a very high frame rate and a sense of speed that was ambitious for the time. It used a unique rendering technique to achieve its visual style.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was cancelled due to technical difficulties and concerns about the PlayStation's hardware limitations. Psygnosis reportedly struggled to achieve a stable frame rate and consistent performance. They felt the game wasn't polished enough for release.

**Legacy:**

Despite never being released, *Neon Vortex* has become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Screenshots and videos of the game have circulated online for years, and it's considered a "lost gem" of the PlayStation era. It heavily influenced the development of *Wipeout XL*, which Psygnosis released a year later.
