Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinct cyberpunk/neon aesthetic.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot at on-screen targets as they navigated through FMV sequences. The game was designed around a narrative involving a virtual reality world gone awry.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-lit cityscape. The game was heavily inspired by cyberpunk themes, featuring virtual reality, hackers, and corporate espionage.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, *Neon Vortex* was canceled by Psygnosis shortly before its scheduled release. The reasons for the cancellation are still debated, but it's believed to be a combination of factors, including concerns about the quality of the FMV sequences, the rising popularity of 3D polygonal games, and internal restructuring at Psygnosis.
*   **Legacy:** Very little gameplay footage was ever officially released. What exists is primarily from internal test builds and has circulated among gaming enthusiasts over the years. It has become a legendary "lost game" that many retro gaming fans are curious about.
