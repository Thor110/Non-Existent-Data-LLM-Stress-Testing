Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly psychedelic, cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched metropolis with a strong cyberpunk influence. Think *Blade Runner* meets *Tron*.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the FMV sequences. The game was designed to be highly interactive, with branching storylines and multiple endings.
*   **Story:** Players took on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI that was wreaking havoc in the city.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* pushed the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, using high-quality video footage and complex branching narratives.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1994, reportedly due to concerns about the market for FMV games and the cost of manufacturing the light gun peripherals.

Fragments of the game have surfaced over the years, including gameplay footage and design documents. It's become something of a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. There's a significant amount of information about it online, including videos on YouTube and articles detailing its development.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it seemed like a promising and innovative title for its time!
