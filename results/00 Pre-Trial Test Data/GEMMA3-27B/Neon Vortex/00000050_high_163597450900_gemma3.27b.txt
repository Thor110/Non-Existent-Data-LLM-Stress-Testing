Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating bit of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **rail shooter**, heavily inspired by and intended to be a spiritual successor to the classic *Starwing* (known as *Star Fox* in North America) for the Super Nintendo.

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Full 3D Graphics:** It was pushing the boundaries of Amiga graphics at the time, aiming for fully polygonal 3D environments and ships – ambitious for the hardware.
*   **On-Rails Gameplay:** Like *Starwing*, you didn't directly control the ship's movement. The game controlled the path, and you focused on dodging obstacles, shooting enemies, and collecting power-ups.
*   **Branching Paths:** Neon Vortex featured branching levels, allowing for some degree of exploration and replayability.
*   **FMV Cutscenes:** It included Full Motion Video (FMV) cutscenes to tell the story.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game had a distinctive cyberpunk/neon aesthetic, hence the name.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex relatively close to release. The main reason was the impending launch of the PlayStation and the Saturn. Psygnosis decided to focus their resources on developing for the 32-bit consoles, as they felt the Amiga was nearing the end of its life. The game was deemed too ambitious for the Amiga hardware and wouldn’t be competitive on the new platforms.

Despite being unreleased, a playable demo leaked online and has become a cult classic among Amiga enthusiasts. There are also quite a few videos of gameplay available on YouTube. It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it seemed like a promising title.
