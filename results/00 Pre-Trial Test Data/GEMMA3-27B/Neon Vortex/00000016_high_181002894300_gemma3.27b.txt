Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinct cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city. Players would take on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a criminal organization.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (had the game been released, it would have been designed for use with the PlayStation's light gun peripheral) to shoot enemies and interact with the FMV scenes. The game featured branching storylines and multiple endings.
*   **Development:** Developed by Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*).
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being near completion, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1994 due to concerns about the PlayStation's light gun peripheral not being accurate enough to provide a satisfying gameplay experience. Psygnosis felt the game wouldn't meet their quality standards with the existing technology.

Over the years, footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced online, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It's become something of a legendary "lost game" among PlayStation enthusiasts.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, but it remains a compelling example of a promising game lost to the limitations of technology at the time.
