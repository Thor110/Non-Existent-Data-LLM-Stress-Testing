Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was supposed to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter. Think *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with entirely live-action footage.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players would take on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a criminal organization.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot at on-screen targets during live-action scenes. The game was designed to have branching storylines and multiple endings.
*   **Technical Innovation:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of what was possible with FMV technology at the time, aiming for a cinematic and immersive experience.

**Why was it cancelled?**

The game was cancelled due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** Working with FMV was incredibly demanding on the PlayStation's hardware. Achieving smooth playback and responsive gameplay proved difficult.
*   **High Production Costs:** Creating high-quality live-action footage was expensive and time-consuming.
*   **Market Concerns:** Psygnosis reportedly worried that the game wouldn't appeal to a broad enough audience.

Only a very limited amount of footage from *Neon Vortex* has surfaced online, but it gives a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been a groundbreaking title. It remains a legendary "lost game" for many PlayStation enthusiasts.
