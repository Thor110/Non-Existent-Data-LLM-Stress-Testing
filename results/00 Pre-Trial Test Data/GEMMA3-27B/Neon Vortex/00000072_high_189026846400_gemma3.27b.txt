Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, fast-paced, **rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Rail shooter, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Point Blank*, but with a heavy emphasis on psychedelic visuals and a trance-like atmosphere.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would control a cursor and shoot enemies as the camera moved along a fixed path. The game was designed to be extremely fast and challenging.
*   **Visuals:** *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a showcase for the PlayStation 1's graphical capabilities, with vibrant colors, abstract shapes, and intense visual effects. It was heavily inspired by the rave and electronic music scene of the early 1990s.
*   **Music:** The game featured a soundtrack of trance and electronic music, designed to complement the visual experience.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis (later absorbed into Sony Computer Entertainment) cancelled the game relatively late in development, reportedly because they felt it didn't fit with their overall brand image. They were concerned it was *too* different and might not appeal to a broad audience.
*   **Legacy:** Footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have circulated online for years, making it a legendary "lost game" among PlayStation enthusiasts. It's considered a significant example of a game that pushed the boundaries of visual and auditory design.

While it never saw the light of day, *Neon Vortex* has gained a cult following due to its unique concept and striking visuals. It remains a tantalizing "what if" in gaming history.
