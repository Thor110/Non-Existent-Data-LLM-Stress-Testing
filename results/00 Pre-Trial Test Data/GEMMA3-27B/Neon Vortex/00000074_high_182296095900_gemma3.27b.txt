Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinct cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched metropolis. The player takes on the role of a law enforcer tasked with stopping criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on-screen, progressing through various scenarios. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings based on player choices.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, aiming for high-quality video sequences and immersive environments.

**Why was it cancelled?**

The game was ultimately cancelled due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The PlayStation 1 had limited storage capacity, and the high-resolution FMV sequences were proving difficult to compress without significant quality loss.
*   **Cost:** The production of FMV games was expensive, requiring actors, sets, and extensive video editing.
*   **Competition:** The light gun shooter market was becoming increasingly crowded, with several successful titles already available.

Very little gameplay footage exists, but what has surfaced shows a visually striking and ambitious project. It remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore for collectors and enthusiasts.
