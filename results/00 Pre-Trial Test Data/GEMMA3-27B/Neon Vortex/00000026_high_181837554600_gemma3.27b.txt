Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the 3DO.

Here's a breakdown of what it was supposed to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinctly cyberpunk/neon aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cityscape. You played as a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (presumably the 3DO's light gun peripheral) to shoot enemies and interact with the on-screen action. The game featured live-action actors and CGI effects.
*   **Unique Feature:** It was notable for its ambitious use of CGI and its attempt to create a truly immersive, cinematic experience.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex in 1994 due to concerns about the 3DO's declining market share and the high cost of producing FMV games. The game was deemed too risky to release given the circumstances.

**Legacy:**

Despite never being released, Neon Vortex has become a legendary lost game. Gameplay footage has surfaced online, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It's considered a significant example of an unreleased title that pushed the boundaries of FMV technology.
