Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1, and would have been quite groundbreaking for its time.

Here's a breakdown of the game:

*   **Genre:** Rail Shooter (similar to *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*, but fully 3D). You wouldn't directly control movement, but rather steer and shoot within a predetermined path.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched virtual reality world. The player takes on the role of a hacker navigating a digital landscape.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would fly through cyberspace, battling viruses and other digital threats. It was envisioned to be fast-paced and visually stunning, taking advantage of the PlayStation 1's early 3D capabilities.
*   **Technical Innovation:** Neon Vortex was notable for its ambitious use of polygonal graphics and texture mapping, pushing the limits of the PlayStation 1 hardware. It used a unique "vector beam" rendering technique to create the neon visuals.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, the game was canceled in 1994 due to technical challenges and concerns about the PlayStation 1's ability to handle the game's demanding graphics. Psygnosis felt it wouldn't run smoothly enough to provide a good experience.

While never released, gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore and a testament to Psygnosis's willingness to experiment with new technologies.
