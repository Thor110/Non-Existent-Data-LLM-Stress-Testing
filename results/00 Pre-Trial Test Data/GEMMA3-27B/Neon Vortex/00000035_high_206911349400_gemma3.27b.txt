Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, first-person puzzle-action game developed by Psygnosis (later Psygnosis Digital) for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of the game type and its features:

*   **Genre:** First-Person Puzzle-Action. It's often described as a blend of *Lemmings* and *Marble Madness* in a fully 3D environment.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a stream of "pixies" (small, glowing creatures) and guided them through complex, Escher-like levels. You didn’t directly control a single character; instead, you manipulated the environment (rotating platforms, opening pathways) to direct the pixies towards the exit.
*   **Visual Style:** The game was known for its vibrant, neon-lit graphics and abstract, geometric level design. The intention was to create a visually stunning and disorienting experience. It aimed for a very distinctive, almost hallucinatory aesthetic.
*   **Sound Design:** The soundtrack, composed by Tim Wright (known for his work on *Wipeout*), was a crucial part of the experience, enhancing the psychedelic atmosphere.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being relatively far along in development, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1995. The reasons cited were a combination of technical challenges (getting the game to run smoothly on the PlayStation) and concerns about its appeal to a broad audience. Psygnosis felt it was too niche and wouldn't sell well.

While never released, gameplay footage and screenshots have circulated online, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become a bit of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts, known for its ambitious concept and unique visual style.
