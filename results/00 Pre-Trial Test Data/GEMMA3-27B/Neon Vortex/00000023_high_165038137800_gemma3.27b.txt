Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Think *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a more psychedelic and futuristic aesthetic.
*   **Premise:** Players took on the role of a security operative tasked with infiltrating a virtual reality nightclub called the "Neon Vortex" to stop a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the environment within the VR nightclub. The game was heavily reliant on pre-rendered FMV sequences.
*   **Unique Features:** It was intended to have a branching storyline, multiple endings, and a distinctive visual style inspired by cyberpunk and rave culture.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, the game was canceled in 1994, reportedly due to concerns about its violent content and the difficulty of accurately syncing the FMV sequences with the gameplay. Psygnosis felt it wouldn't meet their quality standards for release.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and information about Neon Vortex have surfaced over the years, making it a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. It remains a highly sought-after piece of gaming "lost media."
