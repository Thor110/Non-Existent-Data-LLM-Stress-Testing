Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinctly psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cityscape inspired by cyberpunk themes.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the FMV sequences. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings.
*   **Story:** The player takes on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Development:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology with this game, aiming for a visually stunning and immersive experience.
*   **Cancellation:** Unfortunately, the game was canceled in 1994 due to a combination of factors, including technical challenges with the FMV technology, the rising cost of development, and concerns about the game's marketability.

Footage of Neon Vortex remains elusive, but some brief clips and screenshots have surfaced over the years, showcasing the game's unique visual style and ambitious scope. It's become a bit of a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts.
