Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating and mysterious piece of gaming history.

Neon Vortex, the unreleased 1994 Psygnosis game, was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. However, it was *very* different in style and scope.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** It was set in a gritty, futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Non-Linear Narrative:** Unlike most FMV shooters, Neon Vortex was designed with a branching narrative. Your choices and actions during the gameplay would affect the story's outcome. It was ambitious for the time.
*   **Multiple Playable Characters:** You could choose to play as one of several characters, each with their own unique abilities and perspectives on the story.
*   **Complex Story:** The plot revolved around a conspiracy involving a powerful corporation and a virtual reality network.
*   **Innovative Gameplay:** It wasn't just about shooting; the game incorporated puzzle-solving and investigation elements.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to optimize for the hardware of the time. Neon Vortex was pushing the boundaries of what was possible.
*   **Rising Costs:** The production costs were escalating rapidly.
*   **Changing Market:** The gaming landscape was shifting, and Psygnosis decided to focus on other projects.

**Legacy:**

Footage of Neon Vortex leaked online in the early 2000s, sparking interest and curiosity among gaming enthusiasts. It remains a legendary unreleased title, a testament to Psygnosis's ambitious vision. There's a lot of information and footage available on YouTube if you're interested in learning more.
