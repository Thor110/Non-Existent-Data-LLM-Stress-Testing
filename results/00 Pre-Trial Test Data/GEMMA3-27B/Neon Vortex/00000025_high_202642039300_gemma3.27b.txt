Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D racing game** – a very ambitious project for 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** 3D Racing / Futuristic Combat Racing. It was heavily inspired by *Wipeout*, another Psygnosis racing title, but with a much more complex and experimental approach.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would pilot futuristic vehicles through abstract, neon-lit courses. It wasn't just about speed; it involved collecting power-ups, dodging obstacles, and engaging in combat with other racers.
*   **Technology:** Neon Vortex was pushing the boundaries of what was possible on the Amiga and PlayStation at the time. It used vector graphics to create its 3D environments, which was a relatively uncommon approach for racing games back then. This allowed for smooth scaling and rotation, but it also presented significant challenges in terms of rendering and performance.
*   **Unique Features:** It was going to feature a dynamic track system where sections of the course would change during the race.

**Why it was cancelled:**

The game was ultimately cancelled due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** Creating a stable and performant 3D racing game on the hardware of the time proved incredibly difficult. The vector graphics system was demanding, and optimization was a constant struggle.
*   **Development Costs:** The project was becoming increasingly expensive and time-consuming.
*   **Shifting Priorities:** Psygnosis was also working on other titles, and resources were reallocated.

Despite never being released, Neon Vortex has become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, showcasing its unique visual style and ambitious design. It remains a fascinating example of a game that was ahead of its time.
