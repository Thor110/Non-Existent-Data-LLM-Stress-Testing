Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on screen. The game was designed around a futuristic, cyberpunk setting with a complex narrative.
*   **FMV Focus:** *Neon Vortex* heavily relied on full-motion video sequences. The game featured live actors and elaborate sets to create an immersive experience.
*   **Branching Narrative:** The game was supposed to have a branching storyline, with player choices affecting the plot and outcome.
*   **Technical Challenges:** It was ambitious for its time, pushing the limits of FMV technology on the PlayStation. The game suffered from significant technical issues, particularly with tracking and synchronization, which ultimately led to its cancellation.
*   **Psygnosis's Troubles:** *Neon Vortex* was one of several ambitious projects cancelled by Psygnosis during a period of financial difficulties.

While it was never officially released, gameplay footage and details have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become something of a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts.
