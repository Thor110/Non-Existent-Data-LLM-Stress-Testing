Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, but with a distinct psychedelic, cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on-screen, navigating through branching pathways and multiple endings.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched metropolis controlled by a powerful corporation. The player takes on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with infiltrating the corporation and uncovering its secrets.
*   **FMV:** The game relied heavily on pre-rendered full-motion video sequences, featuring live actors and elaborate sets.
*   **Branching Narrative:** *Neon Vortex* was designed with a non-linear narrative, where player choices and shooting accuracy would influence the story's progression and ultimately lead to different outcomes.
*   **Psygnosis's Ambition:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, aiming to create a truly immersive and cinematic gaming experience.

**Why it was cancelled:**

The game was cancelled in 1995, reportedly due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to develop, requiring massive amounts of storage space and processing power.
*   **Rising Costs:** The production costs of *Neon Vortex* were escalating rapidly, making it increasingly difficult to justify the investment.
*   **Shifting Market Trends:** The FMV genre was losing popularity as 3D graphics became more prevalent.

Despite its cancellation, *Neon Vortex* has become a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage of the game has surfaced online, showcasing its unique visual style and ambitious gameplay concepts. It remains a tantalizing example of what could have been.
