Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a bit of a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story of a game that never saw the light of day.

*Neon Vortex* was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. However, it was far more ambitious and complex than those titles.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter / Interactive Movie
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. The game was set in a sprawling metropolis called 'New Shanghai' in 2047.
*   **Gameplay:** Players took on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with tracking down criminals. It was designed to have a branching storyline with multiple endings, determined by player choices and shooting accuracy. It featured live-action actors, elaborate sets, and extensive use of CGI.
*   **Unique Feature:** It wasn't just about shooting; the game emphasized investigation and interrogation of characters. Players would have to gather clues, analyze evidence, and make deductions to progress.
*   **Technology:** It was being developed for the 32-bit consoles of the time (PlayStation and Sega Saturn), pushing the limits of FMV technology.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to develop, requiring a lot of storage space and processing power. The game was pushing the hardware to its limits.
*   **Cost:** The production costs were escalating rapidly due to the extensive use of live-action footage and CGI.
*   **Changing Market:** The gaming market was shifting, and Psygnosis decided to focus on more conventional titles.



While never released, footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, revealing a truly ambitious and innovative game that was ahead of its time. It's become something of a legendary lost title among gaming enthusiasts. You can find some gameplay footage on YouTube if you're interested in seeing what it looked like!
