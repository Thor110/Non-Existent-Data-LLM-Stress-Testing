Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the style of *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through levels filled with futuristic environments and enemies.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a cyberpunk/neon-drenched world, hence the name. It involved a protagonist investigating a conspiracy within a virtual reality network.
*   **FMV:** The entire game was to be rendered using pre-recorded full-motion video footage of actors and sets. This was a popular (and often technically challenging) approach in the mid-90s.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was intended to have branching storylines and multiple endings based on player choices and performance.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, despite being nearly complete, Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1994. The reasons were a combination of technical difficulties with the FMV implementation (getting smooth playback on the hardware of the time was a huge challenge) and concerns about the rising costs of FMV game development.

Footage of the game has surfaced over the years, and it’s clear it was visually impressive for its time. It’s become something of a legendary “lost game” among retro gaming enthusiasts.
