Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**. 

Think along the lines of *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very distinct psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Premise:** Players took on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI that had taken control of a futuristic virtual reality system.
*   **Gameplay:** Players used a light gun to shoot at on-screen targets during FMV sequences. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings.
*   **Aesthetic:** It was known for its incredibly vibrant, neon-soaked visuals, heavily inspired by cyberpunk and rave culture. The FMV sequences were very stylish and ambitious for the time.
*   **Why it was cancelled:** Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex due to concerns about its violent content and the perceived lack of market appeal for FMV games. They were also reportedly unhappy with the quality of the acting in the FMV sequences.

Despite being cancelled, gameplay footage and screenshots of Neon Vortex have surfaced over the years, and it's become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. It's a prime example of an ambitious game that was ahead of its time.

You can find videos of gameplay on YouTube if you're curious! It’s quite a spectacle.
