Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the vein of *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on screen. The game was designed around a cyberpunk/neon-noir aesthetic.
*   **Story:** The premise involved a detective investigating a conspiracy within a futuristic city. The story was delivered through FMV cutscenes featuring live actors.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time. *Neon Vortex* was intended to showcase their capabilities, using pre-rendered 3D environments combined with live-action footage.
*   **Cancellation:** Unfortunately, the game was cancelled in 1994, reportedly due to technical difficulties and concerns about the cost of completing the project. The technology was proving difficult to get right consistently.
*   **Legacy:** A short gameplay demo was leaked online years later, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It's considered a "lost game" and a cult classic among FMV enthusiasts.

There's some interesting footage and information about *Neon Vortex* available online if you're curious. It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it looked like it could have been a really innovative title.
