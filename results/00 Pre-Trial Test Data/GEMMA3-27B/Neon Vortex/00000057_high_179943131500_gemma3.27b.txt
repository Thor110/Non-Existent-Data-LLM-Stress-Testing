Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by titles like *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on-screen in a futuristic, neon-drenched setting. The game was designed to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Setting:** The story revolved around a virtual reality training program gone wrong. Players took on the role of a trainee navigating a dangerous virtual world.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, using pre-rendered 3D environments and live-action footage. It was intended to showcase the capabilities of the PlayStation.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994. The reasons were complex, but primarily involved concerns about the game's quality and the rapidly evolving gaming landscape. FMV games were becoming less popular, and the development team struggled to achieve the desired level of polish.

Over the years, footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced online, revealing a promising but ultimately unfulfilled project. It remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore for collectors and enthusiasts.
