Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very distinct and ambitious style.

Here's a breakdown of what it was going to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. The game was set in a virtual reality arcade where players take on the role of a security operative.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen during FMV sequences. It featured branching storylines and multiple endings based on player choices and accuracy.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its use of rotoscoping—a technique where live-action footage is traced over to create a stylized, animated look. This gave the game a very distinctive visual style.
*   **Cancelled Development:** Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1995 due to technical difficulties and concerns about the quality of the FMV sequences. The game was notoriously difficult to get working reliably on the hardware of the time.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a well-known "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. It remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore.
