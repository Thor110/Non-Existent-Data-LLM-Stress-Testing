Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the vein of *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, which were becoming popular at the time.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (similar to those used in arcade games) to shoot targets on-screen. The game was designed around a futuristic cyberpunk setting.
*   **FMV Focus:** It heavily relied on full-motion video sequences, meaning real actors and sets were filmed and integrated into the game.
*   **Story:** The plot involved a detective investigating a conspiracy in a neon-lit, dystopian city.
*   **Technical Challenges:** *Neon Vortex* was ambitious for its time. It pushed the limits of the PlayStation's hardware, especially with rendering and synchronizing the FMV with the light gun input.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite significant development, Psygnosis ultimately cancelled the game in 1994. The primary reasons cited were technical difficulties, particularly getting the light gun tracking to work reliably with the FMV, and concerns about the game's overall quality.

While never officially released, footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse into what could have been a unique and innovative title. It remains a notable "lost game" for PlayStation enthusiasts.
