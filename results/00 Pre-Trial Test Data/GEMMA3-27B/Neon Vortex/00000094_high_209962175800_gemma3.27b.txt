Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very distinct cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what it was shaping up to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk city. The game took place in a virtual reality world where players took on the role of a bounty hunter.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, navigating through various scenarios and engaging in combat. It was planned to feature branching storylines and multiple endings, depending on player choices and accuracy.
*   **Technology:** It was designed to take advantage of the emerging CD-ROM technology and the PlayStation's (then upcoming) capabilities. It utilized pre-rendered full-motion video sequences for its environments and characters.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its ambitious use of CGI and its gritty, film noir-inspired visual style.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* relatively late in development (around 1995). The main reasons cited were:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to develop, requiring a lot of storage space and processing power. The PlayStation's hardware struggled to handle the game's demanding visuals.
*   **Rising Costs:** The production costs for FMV games were high, and Psygnosis likely deemed the project too expensive to complete.
*   **Changing Market:** The gaming market was shifting towards 3D polygonal graphics, and Psygnosis may have felt that FMV games were becoming outdated.

Despite being unreleased, footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, offering a glimpse into what could have been a unique and innovative game. It remains a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts.
