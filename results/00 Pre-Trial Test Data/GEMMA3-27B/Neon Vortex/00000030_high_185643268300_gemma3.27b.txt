Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **first-person puzzle-action game** with a strong emphasis on atmosphere and unique gameplay mechanics.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Primarily a first-person puzzle game, but with action elements involving manipulating the environment and avoiding hazards. It wasn't a traditional shooter.
*   **Setting:** The game took place within a bizarre, abstract, and visually striking world composed of interconnected neon-lit corridors and chambers. The aesthetic was heavily inspired by the works of M.C. Escher and the cyberpunk genre.
*   **Gameplay:** Players navigated this labyrinthine world, solving puzzles by rotating and reconfiguring the environment to create pathways and access new areas. It used a unique "gravity shifting" mechanic where players could alter the orientation of the level.
*   **Story:** The narrative was minimal, focusing on exploration and atmosphere. The player controlled a character seemingly trapped within this strange reality.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex in 1994, citing concerns about its unconventional gameplay and potential lack of mass-market appeal. It was considered too different and potentially confusing for mainstream gamers at the time.

**Legacy:**
