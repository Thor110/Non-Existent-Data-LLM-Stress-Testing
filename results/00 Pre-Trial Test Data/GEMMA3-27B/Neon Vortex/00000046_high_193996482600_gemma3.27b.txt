Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired world with neon-lit environments (hence the name).
*   **Story:** The player takes on the role of a special agent tasked with infiltrating a criminal organization. The story was non-linear, with branching paths and multiple endings.
*   **Gameplay:** The game featured a mix of shooting galleries and interactive cutscenes. Players would make choices that affected the story's outcome.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, and *Neon Vortex* was meant to be a showcase for their capabilities. It used pre-rendered 3D graphics combined with live-action footage.

**Why it was cancelled:**

The game was cancelled in 1994 due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to develop, and *Neon Vortex* was particularly ambitious. The large amount of video footage required significant storage space on the PlayStation's CD-ROM.
*   **Performance Issues:** Getting the game to run smoothly with the required frame rate proved to be a challenge.
*   **Cost:** The production costs were high, and Psygnosis reportedly lost a substantial amount of money on the project.
*   **Changing Market:** The gaming landscape was evolving, and Psygnosis decided to focus on other projects.

**Legacy:**

Despite being unreleased, *Neon Vortex* has become a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage of the game has surfaced online, and it remains a symbol of ambitious, yet ultimately unrealized, gaming potential. There's a fascinating documentary about the game's development called "Neon Vortex: The Lost Psygnosis Game" which is well worth watching if you're interested in the story!
