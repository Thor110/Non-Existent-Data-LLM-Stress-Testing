Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter – Think *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with entirely live-action footage.
*   **Setting:** A cyberpunk/neon-drenched future, heavily inspired by films like *Blade Runner* and *Dark City*.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (likely the PlayStation GunCon) to shoot enemies and interact with the on-screen action. The game featured a branching storyline and multiple endings.
*   **Story:** You played as a detective investigating a series of murders in a futuristic metropolis. The gameplay involved interrogating suspects and shooting criminals.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its ambitious use of CGI and practical effects blended with live-action footage.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis ultimately cancelled *Neon Vortex* due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to optimize for the PlayStation 1's hardware. The game suffered from performance issues, including jerky video playback.
*   **High Production Costs:** Creating high-quality FMV footage was expensive and time-consuming.
*   **Market Trends:** The popularity of FMV games began to wane as 3D polygonal graphics became more prevalent.

While never officially released, footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. There's even a playable demo available online if you're curious!



It's a great example of a game that was ahead of its time, but ultimately fell victim to the limitations of the technology and changing market conditions.
