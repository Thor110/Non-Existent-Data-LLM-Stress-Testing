Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, free-roaming vehicular combat game** for the PlayStation 1. 

Here's a breakdown of the game type and its features:

*   **Genre:** It's most accurately described as a 3D tank combat game with a strong emphasis on exploration and freedom of movement. Think of it as a precursor to games like *Twisted Metal* or *Red Faction*, but with a much larger and more open environment.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled heavily armed vehicles in a vast, futuristic cityscape. The key innovation was the ability to drive *anywhere* – up the sides of buildings, over rooftops, and through the city's infrastructure. There were no invisible walls or limitations on movement.
*   **Setting:** A dystopian, neon-lit cyberpunk city.
*   **Vehicles:** Players could choose from a variety of vehicles, each with unique weapons and abilities.
*   **Multiplayer:** It was designed to support up to 8 players in split-screen multiplayer.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Despite its innovative gameplay, *Neon Vortex* was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994. The primary reasons were:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The game pushed the PlayStation 1 hardware to its absolute limits. Maintaining a stable framerate and preventing graphical glitches proved incredibly difficult.
*   **Complexity:** The free-roaming environment and complex physics system were challenging to balance and refine.
*   **Market Concerns:** Psygnosis reportedly feared that the game was too ambitious and wouldn't appeal to a mass audience.



While never released, gameplay footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, showcasing its groundbreaking potential. It remains a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts and a prime example of a promising game that was lost to history.
