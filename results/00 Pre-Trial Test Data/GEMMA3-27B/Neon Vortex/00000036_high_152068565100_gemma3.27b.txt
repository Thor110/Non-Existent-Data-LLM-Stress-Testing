Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have taken on the role of a bounty hunter navigating a futuristic, neon-drenched cityscape. The core gameplay revolved around shooting targets on-screen using a light gun.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a dystopian future filled with virtual reality, corporate control, and underground rebellion. The visual style was heavily inspired by cyberpunk and rave culture.
*   **FMV:** The entire game was planned to be presented using pre-rendered full-motion video sequences, featuring live actors and elaborate sets.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was designed to be played with a specially designed, vibrating light gun that would provide haptic feedback during gameplay. This was intended to enhance the immersive experience.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis ultimately cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1995, citing technical difficulties and concerns about the cost of completing the project. The game was notoriously close to completion, with a nearly finished demo existing.

While never officially released, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts. It's considered a lost gem and a prime example of the ambitious FMV games of the mid-1990s.

You can find videos of the demo gameplay on YouTube if you're curious! It's a very striking and unique visual experience.
