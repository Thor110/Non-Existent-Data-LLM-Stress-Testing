Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the vein of *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Platform:** PlayStation (originally planned)
*   **Developer:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout*, *Lemmings*, and *Shadow of the Beast*)
*   **Premise:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players would take on the role of an agent tasked with infiltrating a criminal organization.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and objects on-screen, progressing through a branching storyline with multiple endings. It was designed to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Cancellation:** *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1994, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the FMV technology and concerns about the PlayStation's light gun support. Psygnosis felt they couldn't achieve the quality they were aiming for.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become a bit of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts, and is often cited as a "lost game" that many would have loved to see finished.

You can find videos of the gameplay on YouTube if you're interested in seeing it in action. It's a shame it never saw the light of day, but it's a testament to Psygnosis's ambition and willingness to experiment with new technologies.
