Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1, and a very ambitious one at that.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** Rail Shooter (similar to *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*). The player would move along a fixed path, focusing on shooting enemies.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world, hence the name.
*   **Gameplay:** The game was designed to be incredibly fast-paced and visually stunning, utilizing the PlayStation 1's 3D capabilities to create a sense of speed and immersion. It would have featured a variety of weapons and enemies.
*   **Unique Feature:** The most innovative aspect of *Neon Vortex* was its use of procedural generation. The levels were not pre-designed, but rather created on the fly by the game engine, promising near-infinite replayability.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Despite its promise, *Neon Vortex* was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994. The main reason was that the procedural generation technology, while innovative, proved too unstable and difficult to control. It was producing unpredictable and often unplayable levels. The game was also pushing the limits of the PlayStation 1's hardware at the time.

**Legacy:**

Footage of *Neon Vortex* remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore. It's considered a "lost game" and a testament to the risks and rewards of pushing technological boundaries. It's become something of a legend among retro gaming enthusiasts.
