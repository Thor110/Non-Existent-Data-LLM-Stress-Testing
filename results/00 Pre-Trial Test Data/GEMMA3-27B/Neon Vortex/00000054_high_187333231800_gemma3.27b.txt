Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a deep dive into gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, fast-paced, rail shooter – think along the lines of *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*, but with a much more intense, abstract visual style.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Rail Shooter / On-rails FPS
*   **Visual Style:** Highly psychedelic, neon-infused graphics. The game was built around a unique "vector graphics" engine, giving it a very distinctive look. Environments were abstract and disorienting.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would control a ship moving along a fixed path, shooting at enemies. The gameplay was intended to be incredibly fast and chaotic.
*   **Story:** The story was minimal, focusing on navigating a bizarre, digital world.
*   **Platform:** Originally developed for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1994, very close to release. The reasons were a mix of factors, including concerns about the game's intense visuals potentially causing motion sickness and the 3DO's limited market.

**Legacy:**

*   Gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, creating a cult following among retro gaming enthusiasts.
*   It's considered a "lost gem" of the 3DO era.
*   The game's unique visuals and ambitious design have influenced other titles.
