Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1, and a significant departure for Psygnosis.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** Rail shooter (similar to *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*), but with fully polygonal 3D environments.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would control a ship navigating through abstract, neon-lit tunnels and landscapes. The game emphasized speed and intense action. It was described as a "sensory overload."
*   **Visual Style:** Distinctive and psychedelic, with vibrant colors, geometric shapes, and a focus on creating a disorienting and immersive experience.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of the PlayStation 1's hardware. It used a custom rendering engine to achieve its 3D visuals, but this proved to be its downfall.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being quite far along in development, Psygnosis ultimately canceled *Neon Vortex* in 1994. The primary reason was that it was incredibly difficult to get the game to run at a playable framerate on the PlayStation 1. The hardware simply couldn't handle the complexity of the 3D graphics without significant slowdown.

While never released, gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a legendary "lost game" and a cautionary tale about the challenges of early 3D game development.
