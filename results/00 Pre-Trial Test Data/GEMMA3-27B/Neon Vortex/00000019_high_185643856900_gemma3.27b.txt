Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **3D puzzle-action game** for the PlayStation. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship navigating a series of abstract, neon-lit tunnels. The goal was to solve puzzles and defeat enemies by manipulating the environment and using the ship's weapons. It heavily emphasized speed and reflexes.
*   **Perspective:** It used a fast-paced, first-person perspective, similar to *Star Wars: X-Wing* or *Tie Fighter*, but with a much more abstract and visually striking aesthetic.
*   **Technology:** Neon Vortex was notable for its ambitious use of early 3D graphics on the PlayStation. It pushed the console's hardware to its limits, and that ultimately contributed to its cancellation.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1994, reportedly due to technical difficulties and concerns about its playability. It was deemed too difficult and frustrating for a mainstream audience.
*   **Legacy:** Despite never being released, Neon Vortex gained a cult following due to leaked screenshots and videos. It remains a highly sought-after piece of unreleased gaming history.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it looked like a genuinely innovative and unique game for its time.
