Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story of a game that never saw the light of day.

*Neon Vortex* was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the Sega 32X. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have taken on the role of a bounty hunter navigating a futuristic, neon-drenched city. The gameplay involved shooting enemies and interacting with live-action actors.
*   **Technology:** It was ambitious for its time, utilizing a large amount of pre-rendered full-motion video footage. The game was designed to push the limits of the Sega 32X's capabilities.
*   **Story:** The game had a noir-inspired cyberpunk story, set in a dystopian future.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994, very close to release. The reasons were a combination of factors, including the waning popularity of the Sega 32X, concerns about the quality of the FMV footage, and the increasing cost of development.

Despite its cancellation, some gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become something of a legendary "lost game" among retro gaming enthusiasts.

It's a real shame it never released, as it seemed like a genuinely innovative and ambitious title for its time.
