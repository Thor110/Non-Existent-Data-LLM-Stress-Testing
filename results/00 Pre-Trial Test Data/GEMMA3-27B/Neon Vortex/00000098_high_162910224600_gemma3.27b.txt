Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter – Similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a much more psychedelic and futuristic aesthetic.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through levels filled with bizarre visuals and enemies. The story involved players navigating a virtual reality world.
*   **Psygnosis's Vision:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*) was aiming for a visually striking and immersive experience, leveraging the PlayStation's capabilities at the time.
*   **Why it was cancelled:** The game was cancelled relatively late in development. The primary reason cited was the high cost of producing FMV games and concerns about the quality of the light gun technology available for the PlayStation at the time. The game was reportedly buggy and suffered from tracking issues. Psygnosis didn’t believe they could deliver a polished product that met their standards.
*   **Lost Media:** For a long time, the game was considered lost media. However, in 2023, a near-complete ROM of *Neon Vortex* leaked online, allowing players to finally experience the unfinished game.

It’s a fascinating example of a game that was ahead of its time, and a cautionary tale about the risks of FMV development. You can find gameplay footage and information about it online now that the ROM has surfaced.
