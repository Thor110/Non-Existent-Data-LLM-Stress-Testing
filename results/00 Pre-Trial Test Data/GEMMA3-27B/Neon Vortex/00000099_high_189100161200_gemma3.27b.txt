Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but it was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was meant to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter (similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*)
*   **Setting:** A cyberpunk-inspired world filled with neon lights, futuristic cities, and corporate intrigue.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the environment in live-action video sequences. The game was designed to have a branching narrative with multiple endings.
*   **Story:** You played as a bounty hunter tasked with taking down a powerful corporation.
*   **Technology:** It was planned for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, leveraging the system's FMV capabilities.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* due to a combination of factors:

*   **Rising Development Costs:** FMV games were notoriously expensive to produce due to the cost of filming live-action footage.
*   **Poor Critical Reception of Similar Games:** Other FMV light gun shooters weren't receiving great reviews, leading Psygnosis to question the viability of the genre.
*   **The 3DO's Declining Market Share:** The 3DO was struggling to compete with the PlayStation and Saturn, making it a risky platform for a high-budget game.

While never officially released, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a bit of a legendary "lost" game for those interested in gaming history.
