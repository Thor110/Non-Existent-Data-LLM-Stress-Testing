Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the style of *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a unique twist.

Here's a breakdown of the game:

*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk world filled with neon lights, shadowy corporations, and dangerous criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would take on the role of a security operative tasked with protecting a virtual reality nightclub from hackers and other threats. It used a light gun peripheral for aiming and shooting.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* heavily emphasized a branching narrative based on player choices. Your actions during the shooting sequences would affect the story and lead to different outcomes. It was aiming to blend the action of a light gun game with the storytelling of an interactive movie.
*   **Technology:** The game was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, using a lot of pre-rendered video footage and CGI effects.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The game was proving difficult to get running smoothly on the available hardware. The FMV footage was demanding, and the game suffered from performance issues.
*   **Rising Costs:** Developing FMV games was expensive, and the project was exceeding its budget.
*   **Changing Market:** The light gun shooter market was becoming increasingly competitive, and Psygnosis decided to focus on other projects.

Footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, and it remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore for collectors and enthusiasts. It's a prime example of a promising game that never saw the light of day.
