Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinctly psychedelic and futuristic aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A neon-drenched, cyberpunk-inspired virtual reality world. The player takes on the role of a "data scavenger" tasked with infiltrating a virtual network.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets within the FMV sequences. It was intended to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Technology:** It was developed using a combination of live-action footage and CGI. Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was ultimately cancelled in 1995, reportedly due to technical issues and concerns about the cost of completing the project. The FMV technology was proving difficult to work with reliably, and the game was falling behind schedule.
*   **Legacy:** Despite never being released, *Neon Vortex* has gained a cult following among gaming enthusiasts due to its unique visuals and intriguing concept. Footage of the game has surfaced online, giving us a glimpse of what could have been.

It's a bit of a lost gem of the mid-90s, representing a fascinating, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, experiment in FMV gaming. There are some great videos on YouTube showing gameplay footage if you're interested in seeing it in action!
