Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very different aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players would take on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (had it been released) to shoot at enemies and interact with the environment presented through pre-rendered full-motion video scenes.
*   **Unique Feature:** The game was heavily focused on branching narratives and multiple endings, influenced by player choices and shooting accuracy.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, Neon Vortex was cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994, reportedly due to concerns about its violence and the rising popularity of 3D polygonal graphics. They felt FMV games were becoming dated.

Footage of Neon Vortex leaked online years later, and it remains a highly sought-after piece of gaming lore for collectors and enthusiasts. It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it looked quite promising for its time.
