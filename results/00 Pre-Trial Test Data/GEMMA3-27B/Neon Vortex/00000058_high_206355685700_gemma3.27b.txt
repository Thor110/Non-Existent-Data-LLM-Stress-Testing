Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story of a game that never quite saw the light of day.

*Neon Vortex* was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation. It was being developed by Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*) in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was going to be:

*   **Setting:** A cyberpunk, neon-drenched virtual reality world.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (like the one for *Virtua Cop*) to shoot targets within the FMV environments. It was heavily inspired by the film *Tron*.
*   **Story:** The player takes on the role of a data thief navigating a dangerous virtual landscape.
*   **Technology:** It was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, aiming for a highly immersive and visually impressive experience.

**Why was it cancelled?**

The game was cancelled due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to develop, and *Neon Vortex* was particularly ambitious. Getting smooth, responsive gameplay with high-quality video proved to be a significant hurdle.
*   **Rising Costs:** The cost of FMV production was high, and the project was becoming too expensive.
*   **Changing Market:** The PlayStation was still relatively new, and the market for FMV games was uncertain.

While the game was never released, some gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a legendary unreleased title for gaming enthusiasts.

It's a really interesting example of a promising project that fell victim to the technical and economic realities of game development in the mid-90s.
