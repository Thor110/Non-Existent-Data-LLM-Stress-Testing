Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **FMV Gameplay:** The entire game was filmed with live actors against green screens, and the environments and effects were added in post-production. Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen.
*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched city controlled by a corrupt corporation.
*   **Psychological Themes:** *Neon Vortex* leaned heavily into psychological themes and surreal imagery. The story involved players entering the minds of criminals to extract information.
*   **Branching Storyline:** The game was designed to have a branching narrative, where player choices and actions would affect the story's outcome.
*   **Innovative Control Scheme:** It aimed to have a unique control scheme that went beyond simple point-and-shoot mechanics.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994, just weeks before its scheduled release. The primary reason was the poor performance of the recently released *Hard Drivin'* (another FMV game) and concerns that the market wasn't ready for another expensive, technologically ambitious title. The game was also reportedly plagued by technical issues and a complex development process.

Despite never being officially released, gameplay footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it remains a highly sought-after piece of gaming history. It's considered a prime example of a promising game that fell victim to market forces and technical challenges.
