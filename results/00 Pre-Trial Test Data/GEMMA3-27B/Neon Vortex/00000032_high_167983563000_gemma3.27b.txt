Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a groundbreaking, fully 3D racing game for the PlayStation, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's the breakdown of its game type:

*   **3D Futuristic Racing:** The core gameplay was a fast-paced, futuristic racing experience. Players would pilot sleek, hovering vehicles through vibrant, neon-lit tracks.
*   **Track Manipulation:** This is where it got really interesting. *Neon Vortex* featured a unique mechanic where players could actively manipulate the track itself *during* the race. They could raise, lower, and rotate sections of the track to create shortcuts, obstacles for opponents, or even entirely new paths.
*   **Puzzle-Racing Hybrid:** Because of the track manipulation element, it wasn't *just* a racing game. It also incorporated puzzle-solving aspects, as players needed to strategically alter the track to optimize their route and hinder their rivals.
*   **Split-Screen Multiplayer:** It was designed with a strong emphasis on split-screen multiplayer, allowing up to four players to compete simultaneously.

Essentially, Psygnosis was aiming for a blend of *Wipeout*'s speed and futuristic aesthetic with the track-altering gameplay of something like *Trackmania* (though *Trackmania* came much later).

**Why it was cancelled:**

Despite its innovative concepts, *Neon Vortex* was ultimately cancelled due to technical challenges. The PlayStation hardware of the time struggled to handle the complex 3D graphics and real-time track deformation, resulting in poor performance. Psygnosis decided to shelve the project rather than release a subpar product.

Footage of the game is rare, but it's available on YouTube and provides a glimpse of what could have been a truly revolutionary racing title. It remains a legendary "lost" game for many PlayStation enthusiasts.
