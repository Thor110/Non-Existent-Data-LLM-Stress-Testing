Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very distinct cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk city.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on-screen, progressing through levels and engaging in fast-paced action.
*   **Story:** The plot involved a detective investigating a conspiracy in the cyberpunk city.
*   **Unique Features:** It was notable for its use of pre-rendered 3D graphics blended with live-action FMV sequences. The environments were designed to be visually striking and immersive.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994. The reasons are complex, but a major factor was the rising cost of FMV technology and concerns about the game's marketability. The PlayStation was also a new platform, and Psygnosis shifted focus to other projects.

Over the years, footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced online, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts, and a prime example of a promising game lost to time.
