Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **3D puzzle-action game** – often described as a mix between *Wipeout* and *Blockout*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship through a series of abstract, neon-lit courses. The core mechanic involved manipulating blocks to create pathways and solve puzzles while racing against the clock.
*   **Visual Style:** It was strikingly futuristic and visually distinctive, with a heavy emphasis on bright neon colors and geometric shapes. It was pushing the limits of the Amiga 1200 hardware at the time.
*   **Development:** Psygnosis was very proud of the game and saw it as a potential breakthrough title. However, it was cancelled shortly before release.
*   **Reasons for Cancellation:** The primary reason cited was the impending launch of the PlayStation. Psygnosis decided to focus its resources on the new console, and Neon Vortex, being an Amiga exclusive, was deemed no longer viable.
*   **Legacy:** Despite never being released, Neon Vortex has gained a cult following among Amiga enthusiasts. Gameplay footage and screenshots have circulated online, and it's considered a lost gem of the 16-bit era.

There's a wealth of information available online, including gameplay videos and articles detailing the game's development. It's a tragic story of a promising game that never saw the light of day, but its legacy lives on!
