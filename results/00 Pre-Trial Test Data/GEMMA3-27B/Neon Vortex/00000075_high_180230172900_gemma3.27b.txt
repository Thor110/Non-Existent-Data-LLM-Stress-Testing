Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was supposed to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very distinct aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. The player took on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with taking down criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on-screen during full-motion video sequences. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings.
*   **Unique Feature:** *Neon Vortex* was designed to be incredibly fast-paced and visually striking, with a heavy emphasis on style and atmosphere. It used a unique "morphing" effect to seamlessly blend live-action footage with CGI.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled by Psygnosis shortly before its planned release. The reasons for the cancellation are complex and debated, but factors included concerns about the quality of the FMV technology at the time, the rising cost of production, and the potential for motion sickness.

While never officially released, playable builds of *Neon Vortex* have surfaced online over the years, allowing fans to experience this lost gem of PlayStation history. It's considered a cult classic among collectors and enthusiasts of FMV games.
