Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV light gun shooter – similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinct cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city. Players would take on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with tracking down criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the environment as the game unfolded through pre-rendered FMV sequences.
*   **Unique Feature:** It was meant to utilize a unique "morphing" effect where the FMV footage would seamlessly blend with 3D polygonal environments.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1995, reportedly due to technical difficulties in achieving the desired visual effects and concerns about the game's overall quality.  The PlayStation hardware was also proving challenging for FMV games.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a well-known example of a "lost" game. It’s considered a significant curiosity among gaming enthusiasts.
