Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation in 1994, but it was ultimately cancelled.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a unique cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city (hence the name). Players would take on the role of a law enforcer tasked with stopping criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through levels and engaging in fast-paced action.
*   **Technology:** It was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, using pre-rendered 3D environments combined with live-action footage.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was cancelled due to technical issues and concerns about the quality of the FMV sequences. The PlayStation's hardware struggled to handle the complex visuals and smooth playback required for a satisfying experience. Psygnosis felt it wasn't up to their standards.

While never released, gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts.
