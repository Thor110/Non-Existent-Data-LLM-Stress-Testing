Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story of a game that was nearly released but ultimately cancelled.

Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fully 3D, real-time strategy game with RPG elements.** It was incredibly ambitious for 1994. 

Here's a breakdown of its intended gameplay:

*   **Isometric 3D:** The game used a fully 3D engine to create a dynamic, isometric perspective.
*   **Real-Time Strategy:** Players would control fleets of ships in real-time combat.
*   **RPG Progression:** Ships weren’t just units, they were customizable and could be upgraded with new weapons and abilities, adding RPG-like progression.
*   **Story Driven:** The game had a narrative centered around intergalactic corporations vying for control of resources.
*   **Unique Control Scheme:** It was designed to be controlled primarily with a joystick, which was unusual for strategy games at the time.

Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of what was possible on the Amiga and PC, but the game suffered from technical issues and performance problems. The development team struggled to optimize the game to run smoothly on the hardware of the time. Ultimately, Psygnosis cancelled the project in 1995.

There's a lot of fascinating information and footage of Neon Vortex available online. It's considered a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts. You can find videos of gameplay on YouTube if you're interested!

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it seemed like a truly innovative and ambitious title.
