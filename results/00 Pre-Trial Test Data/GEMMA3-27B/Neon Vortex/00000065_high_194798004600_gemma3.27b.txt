Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **psychedelic, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Primarily a rail shooter, meaning the player character moves automatically along a predetermined path, and the player controls aiming and firing. However, it incorporated elements of a puzzle game and exploration.
*   **Setting:** The game took place within a bizarre, abstract world constructed of neon lights and geometric shapes. The environment was designed to be disorienting and visually striking.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship navigating through this neon landscape, shooting enemies and solving puzzles to progress. It was heavily inspired by the psychedelic art and music of the 1960s.
*   **Unique Mechanics:** Neon Vortex was notable for its use of a "color-matching" mechanic. Players had to change the color of their ship to match the color of enemies or obstacles to destroy them or pass through barriers.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being relatively far along in development, Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex in 1995. The reasons were a combination of factors, including concerns about the game's niche appeal, its difficulty, and the PlayStation 1's evolving market.
*   **Legacy:** A playable demo was leaked online in 2010, allowing fans to experience the unique vision of Neon Vortex. It remains a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts.

It's a game that, had it been released, would have likely stood out significantly from other shooters of the time due to its distinctive visual style and gameplay mechanics. It's a shame it never saw the light of day!
