Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

However, it was *never* officially released. It was cancelled due to a combination of factors, including concerns about the quality of the FMV footage and the limitations of the PlayStation 1 hardware at the time.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (like the Namco GunCon) to shoot enemies and interact with the environment. The game was heavily inspired by the film *Tron*.
*   **Story:** The player takes on the role of a hacker trying to stop a rogue AI.
*   **FMV:** The game relied heavily on full-motion video sequences for cutscenes and in-game action. This was ambitious for the time, but the quality of the footage was reportedly inconsistent.

Despite being cancelled, a playable demo of *Neon Vortex* leaked online in the early 2000s and has since become a sought-after piece of gaming ephemera. It provides a glimpse into what could have been a unique and innovative title for the original PlayStation.

It's a bit of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts, and a reminder of the risks and challenges of pushing the boundaries of technology in game development.
