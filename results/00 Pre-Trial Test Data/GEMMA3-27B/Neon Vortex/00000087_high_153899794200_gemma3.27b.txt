Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, a genre Psygnosis (and its developer, Millennium Interactive) were known for with games like *Cadillacs and Dinosaurs* and *The Last V8*.

However, *Neon Vortex* was significantly more ambitious and complex than those earlier titles. It wasn't just a simple shooting gallery. Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** It was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Branching Narrative:** The game featured a branching storyline with multiple endings, influenced by the player's choices and performance.
*   **Interactive Environments:** Environments weren't static backdrops. Players could shoot objects to trigger events and uncover secrets.
*   **Complex Story:** The narrative involved corporate espionage, virtual reality, and a conspiracy.
*   **Rotoscoped Footage:** The FMV sequences used rotoscoping (tracing over live-action footage) to create a distinct visual style.

Essentially, it aimed to be a cinematic, interactive action thriller. It was meant to be a technological showcase for the PlayStation 1, pushing the limits of what FMV games could achieve.

Sadly, it was cancelled shortly before release due to a combination of factors, including development difficulties, rising costs, and concerns about the PlayStation 1's ability to handle the demanding FMV sequences reliably.

Footage of the game leaked online years later, and it remains a highly sought-after and intriguing piece of gaming lore. You can find gameplay videos on YouTube if you're curious!
