Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Think *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a more psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (had it been released) to shoot targets in live-action FMV sequences. The game featured a non-linear storyline with branching paths, depending on the player's shooting accuracy.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched world filled with hackers, corporations, and virtual reality. The story revolved around a player character tasked with infiltrating a powerful corporation.
*   **Development:** It was ambitious for its time, utilizing a lot of advanced FMV techniques and complex branching narratives.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis ultimately cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to concerns about the quality of the FMV footage and the technical challenges of getting it to run reliably on the PlayStation. They felt it didn't meet their standards.

While never officially released, gameplay footage and details about the game have surfaced over the years, making it a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. It remains a captivating glimpse into a cancelled vision of early PlayStation gaming.
