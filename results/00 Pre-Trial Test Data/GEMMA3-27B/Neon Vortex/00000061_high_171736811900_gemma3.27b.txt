Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, but with a unique cyberpunk/noir aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city. Players took on the role of a police officer investigating a series of crimes.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through various scenarios and engaging in quick-time events.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, using pre-rendered 3D environments and live-action actors.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was cancelled in 1995, reportedly due to technical issues and concerns about the market viability of FMV games. The PlayStation was moving towards polygon-based graphics, and FMV games were starting to fall out of favor.
*   **Legacy:** Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced online over the years, showcasing its unique style and ambitious scope. It remains a sought-after curiosity among gaming enthusiasts.

It's considered a "lost game" - a project that never saw the light of day but has captured the imagination of many due to its intriguing concept and the mystery surrounding its cancellation.
