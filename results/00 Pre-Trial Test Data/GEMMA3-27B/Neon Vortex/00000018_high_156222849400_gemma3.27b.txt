Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired world with a strong emphasis on neon visuals (hence the name). The game was set in a sprawling virtual reality nightclub.
*   **Gameplay:** Players took on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a hacker who was wreaking havoc within the virtual club. The gameplay involved shooting enemies, protecting VIPs, and completing objectives within the VR environment.
*   **Unique Feature:** It was meant to feature a branching storyline and multiple endings based on player choices and performance.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* relatively late in development, reportedly due to concerns about the quality of the FMV footage and the difficulty of creating a compelling gameplay experience. They felt it didn't meet their standards for a PlayStation launch title.

**Legacy:**

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it's become something of a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts. It's a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been, and a reminder of the risks involved in pushing the boundaries of gaming technology.

You can find videos of gameplay footage on YouTube if you're interested in seeing it in action! It's quite a sight.
