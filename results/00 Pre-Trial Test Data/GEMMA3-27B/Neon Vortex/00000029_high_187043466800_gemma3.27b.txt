Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, rail shooter/on-rails puzzle game developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of the game type and what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Primarily described as an **on-rails shooter** with strong **puzzle elements**. It wasn't a traditional run-and-gun shooter.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would navigate a series of abstract, neon-lit environments on a fixed path (hence "on-rails"). The core gameplay revolved around manipulating the environment – rotating sections of the level, changing colors, and redirecting energy beams – to create a path forward and solve puzzles.
*   **Visual Style:** The game was renowned for its striking, heavily stylized visuals. It was heavily inspired by the work of artist M.C. Escher and featured vibrant neon colors, geometric shapes, and disorienting perspectives. The goal was to create a truly immersive and mind-bending experience.
*   **Story:** The narrative was minimal, focusing on the player's journey through these abstract worlds.
*   **Why it was cancelled:** The game was notoriously difficult to complete and suffered from technical issues. Psygnosis ultimately cancelled it shortly before its scheduled release, citing concerns about its complexity and potential lack of mass appeal.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have circulated online for years, making it a legendary "lost game" among PlayStation enthusiasts. It's considered a cult classic and a prime example of Psygnosis's experimental and artistic approach to game development.
