Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, rail shooter for the PlayStation 1, and a departure for Psygnosis, known for its more realistic and simulation-style games.

Here's a breakdown of the game type:

*   **Genre:** Primarily a **rail shooter**, meaning the player character moves along a predetermined path, and the player controls aiming and firing. Think *Space Harrier* or *Virtua Cop*, but with a much more abstract and surreal aesthetic.
*   **Style:** It was heavily inspired by the trance and rave culture of the early 1990s. The visuals were designed to be intensely colorful, geometric, and hypnotic, intended to sync with the electronic soundtrack.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would navigate through abstract, neon-lit environments, shooting enemies and collecting power-ups. It was meant to be fast-paced and visually overwhelming.
*   **Unique Feature:** A key element was the use of "mood states" that altered the visuals and gameplay. These states were triggered by the player's actions and the environment, creating a dynamic and unpredictable experience.

Unfortunately, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled late in development due to concerns about its potentially seizure-inducing visuals and its departure from Psygnosis's established brand. Only a few minutes of gameplay footage and some concept art have surfaced over the years, making it a sought-after piece of gaming lore.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day – it sounded like a truly unique and ambitious title for its time!
