Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating bit of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **rail shooter**, specifically a **virtual reality-inspired rail shooter**.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Rail shooter, similar to *Star Wars Arcade* or *Virtua Cop*. You move along a fixed path, and the gameplay revolves around shooting targets.
*   **VR Inspiration:** It was designed to simulate the feeling of being inside a virtual reality environment *before* VR technology was really viable for home gaming. The game used a lot of visual tricks to create a sense of depth and immersion.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-lit world (hence the name!). You pilot a ship through a network of glowing tubes and structures.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would shoot down enemy ships and obstacles while navigating the intricate levels.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game shortly before its planned release. The reasons were a combination of factors, including concerns about the game's difficulty and the fact that the VR-like effects might not translate well to standard monitors. The game was also deemed too similar to other titles in development.
*   **Limited Release:** A very small number of demo versions were distributed to gaming magazines for review, but the full game never saw the light of day.

There's a lot of interesting information about Neon Vortex available online, including gameplay footage from the demo versions. It's considered a bit of a lost gem by retro gaming enthusiasts.
