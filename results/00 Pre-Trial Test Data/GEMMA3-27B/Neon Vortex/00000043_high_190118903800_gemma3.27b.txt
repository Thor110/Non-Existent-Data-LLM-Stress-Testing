Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating bit of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter.**

Here's a breakdown of what it was intended to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to games like *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a more psychedelic and surreal aesthetic.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, navigating through bizarre and colorful environments. The game heavily emphasized quick reflexes and precision aiming.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched world, with a storyline involving a rogue AI and a virtual reality system gone awry.
*   **Unique Features:** Neon Vortex was notable for its distinctive visual style, combining live-action footage with computer-generated effects. It aimed for a more mature and edgy tone than many other light gun shooters of the time.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex relatively close to its release date. The primary reason cited was concerns about the game's violence and its potential to receive a high age rating. This was at a time when Psygnosis was aiming for broader appeal with its games. There were also technical issues with the game's FMV implementation.

**Availability:**

Footage of Neon Vortex has surfaced online over the years, and it's considered a bit of a holy grail for collectors of unreleased gaming content. There's a playable demo available, although it's quite rough around the edges.

It's a really interesting case study in game development and the factors that can lead to a project being shelved.
