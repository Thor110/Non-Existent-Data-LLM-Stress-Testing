Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, free-roaming, vehicular combat game** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** The closest comparison would be a blend of *Wipeout* (also a Psygnosis title) and *Stunts*. Think high-speed, futuristic racing, but with a much greater emphasis on free exploration and combat.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a heavily armed vehicle that could fly, drive, and even swim (underwater sections were planned). The game world was a vast, interconnected network of tunnels, cities, and open areas.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of what the original PlayStation could do. It used a complex voxel-based rendering system to create the 3D environments. This was incredibly ambitious for the time.
*   **Story:** The game had a loose narrative about a dystopian future and a rebellion against a controlling corporation.

**Why was it cancelled?**

Despite its potential, *Neon Vortex* was ultimately cancelled in 1996. The primary reasons were:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The voxel engine proved extremely difficult to optimize for the PlayStation's hardware. The game ran very slowly and was prone to glitches.
*   **Development Time:** The project took a long time to develop, and Psygnosis was facing pressure to release more marketable titles.
*   **Rising Competition:** The PlayStation market was becoming increasingly crowded, and Psygnosis felt that *Neon Vortex* was too risky a proposition.

Although never released, gameplay footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a legendary "lost" game and a testament to the ambition of Psygnosis during the early 3D gaming era.
