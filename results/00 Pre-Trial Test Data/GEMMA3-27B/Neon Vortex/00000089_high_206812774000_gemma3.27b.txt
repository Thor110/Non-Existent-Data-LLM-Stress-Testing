Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, rail shooter/on-rails light gun game for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis (later known as Studio Liverpool).

Here's a breakdown of the game type and what made it unique:

*   **Genre:** Primarily an **on-rails shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. However, it was heavily infused with **psychedelic visuals and a strong emphasis on atmosphere.**

*   **Gameplay:** Players would move through abstract, neon-lit environments on a fixed path (the "rails"). Enemies would appear, and players would shoot them using a light gun peripheral (though a controller was also planned).

*   **Unique Features:**
    *   **Abstract Visuals:**  *Neon Vortex* didn't have a traditional narrative or realistic setting. It was designed to be a visually stunning, dreamlike experience. Environments were composed of shifting geometric shapes, vibrant colors, and hypnotic patterns.
    *   **Music-Driven Gameplay:** The game's visuals and action were closely synchronized with the soundtrack, creating a more immersive and rhythmic experience.
    *   **Atmospheric Focus:** Psygnosis aimed to create a game that prioritized mood and atmosphere over traditional scoring or challenge.

*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1994, just before its planned release. The reasons are debated, but it's believed that technical challenges with the PlayStation 1 hardware, combined with concerns about the game's unconventional nature and potential market appeal, led to its demise.

Despite never being released, *Neon Vortex* has become a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage of the game is rare, but it's highly sought after due to its unique vision and the reputation of Psygnosis as a developer of innovative and visually striking games.
