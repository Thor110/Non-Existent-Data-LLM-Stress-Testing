Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter.**

Think along the lines of *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly more psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (intended for the Sega Virtua Gun) to shoot at on-screen targets. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings, driven by player choices and shooting accuracy.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched city controlled by a powerful corporation. The player took on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with taking down the corporation.
*   **FMV:** The entire game was rendered using full-motion video, meaning it consisted of pre-recorded footage of actors and environments.
*   **Why it was cancelled:** The game was ultimately cancelled due to a combination of factors, including technical difficulties with the FMV technology, concerns about the game's violence, and the rising cost of arcade development. Psygnosis also shifted its focus towards PlayStation titles.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and information about Neon Vortex have surfaced over the years, making it a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts. It's a prime example of an ambitious arcade game that never saw the light of day.

You can find gameplay footage on YouTube if you're interested in seeing what it looked like! It's quite striking visually.
