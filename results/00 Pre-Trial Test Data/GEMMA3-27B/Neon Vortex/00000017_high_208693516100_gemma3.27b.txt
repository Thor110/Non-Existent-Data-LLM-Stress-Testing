Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a psychedelic, rail shooter, often described as a blend of *Star Fox* and *Rez*—though it predates *Rez* by several years.

Here's a breakdown of the game type and key features:

*   **Genre:** Rail Shooter / On-Rails Shooter
*   **Perspective:** First-person (though heavily stylized)
*   **Gameplay:** Players would navigate a series of abstract, neon-lit environments on a fixed path. The core mechanic involved shooting geometric shapes and enemies that appeared in sync with the pulsating electronic music.
*   **Visual Style:** The game was renowned for its groundbreaking, vector-based graphics and vibrant, psychedelic color palette. It aimed for a completely immersive and hypnotic visual experience.
*   **Music:** The soundtrack was integral to the gameplay, with the music directly influencing the visuals and enemy patterns.
*   **Technology:** Developed for the PlayStation 1, it pushed the console's hardware to its limits with its complex graphics and sound design.

**Why it was unreleased:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* shortly before its planned release in 1994. The primary reason was that the game caused severe motion sickness in many playtesters. The intense, fast-paced visuals combined with the on-rails movement proved to be too disorienting for a significant portion of players. Despite attempts to mitigate the issue, Psygnosis ultimately deemed it unviable for release.

**Legacy:**

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has circulated online for years, and it's become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. It's remembered as a bold and ambitious project that was ahead of its time, and a cautionary tale about the challenges of creating truly immersive and disorienting gaming experiences.
