Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter – think *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a sci-fi aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players would take on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot at on-screen enemies and interact with the FMV sequences. The game was designed to be heavily narrative-driven, with branching storylines based on player choices.
*   **Technology:** It utilized a large amount of pre-rendered full-motion video, which was ambitious for the time.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* due to several factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The sheer amount of FMV footage proved difficult to manage and optimize for the PlayStation 1's hardware.
*   **Rising Costs:** The production costs were escalating rapidly.
*   **Competition:** The light gun shooter market was becoming increasingly crowded.
*   **Concerns about Gameplay:** Some internal playtesting revealed that the gameplay wasn't as engaging as hoped.

Only a small amount of footage and screenshots from *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a highly sought-after piece of gaming lore. It remains a legendary unreleased title.
