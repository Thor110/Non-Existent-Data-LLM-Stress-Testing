Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by the *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis* arcade games that were popular at the time.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun (similar to those used in arcades) to shoot targets on screen. The game was meant to feature branching storylines and multiple endings, depending on player accuracy and choices.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired world filled with neon lights, virtual reality, and corporate espionage.
*   **Story:** Players took on the role of a "data runner" hired to infiltrate a powerful corporation and steal valuable data.
*   **Development:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*) was developing it for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, the game was never released. Reasons cited included technical difficulties getting the FMV to run smoothly on the hardware, and concerns about the game's overall quality. The game was reportedly very ambitious for the time, and the technology wasn't quite ready to deliver the experience Psygnosis envisioned.

There are some surviving gameplay videos and behind-the-scenes footage available online, which give you a glimpse of what *Neon Vortex* could have been. It's become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts interested in unreleased titles.
