Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **3D puzzle-action game** for the PlayStation 1.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **Isometric Perspective:** The game was played from a top-down, isometric perspective, similar to games like *Syndicate* (also by Psygnosis).
*   **Vehicle-Based:** You controlled a futuristic vehicle – a sort of hovercraft – navigating complex, neon-lit levels.
*   **Puzzle Solving:** The core gameplay revolved around solving puzzles by manipulating the environment. This included rotating sections of the level, activating switches, and using the vehicle's abilities.
*   **Action Elements:** There was also an action component, involving shooting enemies and avoiding obstacles.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game had a distinctive cyberpunk aesthetic with a heavy emphasis on neon lights, reflective surfaces, and a sense of claustrophobia.

Think of it as a blend of *Syndicate*'s isometric action, *Marble Madness*'s track-based gameplay, and a cyberpunk visual style.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Neon Vortex was cancelled relatively late in development due to technical challenges. The PlayStation 1 was still new, and Psygnosis struggled to get the game running smoothly at a consistent frame rate with all the complex 3D effects and environmental manipulation. They ultimately deemed it unviable for release.

Footage of the game is rare, but it's available on YouTube and gives a good sense of what it would have been like. It's become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts.
