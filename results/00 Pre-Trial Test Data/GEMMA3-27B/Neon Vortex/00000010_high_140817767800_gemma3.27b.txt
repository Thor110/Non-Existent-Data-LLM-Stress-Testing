Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. The 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game was a **rail shooter** – specifically, a **virtual reality rail shooter**.

Here's a breakdown of what it was:

*   **Genre:** Rail shooter (similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*) – the player's movement is fixed on a predetermined path, and you focus on shooting enemies.
*   **VR Focus:** Neon Vortex was designed from the ground up for the then-emerging virtual reality headsets, specifically the Sega VR headset. It was intended to be a showcase title for VR gaming.
*   **Gameplay:** Players navigated a neon-drenched, futuristic cityscape, shooting down robotic enemies. It featured a unique visual style with vibrant colors and a focus on speed.
*   **Why it was cancelled:** The Sega VR headset was ultimately cancelled, and the technology wasn't quite ready for a compelling VR experience. Psygnosis decided to shelve Neon Vortex because it was so heavily tied to the VR hardware.
*   **Legacy:** Gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, and it remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore. It’s considered a significant example of early VR game development and a glimpse of what could have been.

It's a bit of a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts, even though it was never officially released to the public. You can find gameplay videos on YouTube if you're interested in seeing it in action!
