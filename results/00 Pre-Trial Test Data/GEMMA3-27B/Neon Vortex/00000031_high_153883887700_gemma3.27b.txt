Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

However, it wasn't just a simple on-rails shooter. *Neon Vortex* was planned to have a branching narrative, meaning your choices and shooting accuracy would affect the storyline and lead to different outcomes. It was meant to be a more interactive and story-driven FMV experience than many of its contemporaries.

Here's a breakdown of key features:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter / Interactive Movie
*   **Setting:** A cyberpunk-inspired world with a neon aesthetic (hence the name).
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets and interact with the on-screen action.
*   **Story:** You played as an agent investigating a mysterious corporation.
*   **Technology:** It was designed to push the limits of the Amiga 1200's hardware, utilizing a custom graphics chip to handle the full-motion video.

The game was notoriously close to completion but was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994 due to concerns about the Amiga 1200's declining market share and the high cost of manufacturing the custom hardware required to run the game properly.

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it remains a sought-after piece of Amiga gaming lore. It's a prime example of an ambitious project that never saw the light of day.
