Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story of a game that was almost released but ultimately cancelled.

*Neon Vortex* was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. However, it was *much* more ambitious than those titles.

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Complex Narrative:** It wasn't a simple "shoot the bad guys" game. It featured a branching narrative with multiple endings, influenced by the player's choices and performance.
*   **Live-Action Cutscenes:** The game used extensive live-action footage with actors, sets, and special effects. It aimed for a cinematic, almost movie-like experience.
*   **Sci-Fi Setting:** The story was set in a futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired world. You played as a security operative investigating a conspiracy within a massive space station.
*   **Unique Gameplay Mechanics:** Beyond shooting, the game incorporated puzzle-solving elements and required players to make quick decisions under pressure.
*   **Advanced Technology:** Psygnosis pushed the limits of the Amiga 1200 hardware to create the game, using a custom video compression system to handle the large amount of FMV footage.

**Why it was cancelled:**

The game suffered from several issues:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The Amiga 1200 struggled to handle the demanding FMV and complex gameplay smoothly.
*   **Budget Concerns:** The production costs were high due to the live-action footage and ambitious scope.
*   **Market Shifts:** The rise of 3D gaming and the PlayStation/Saturn was starting to overshadow the Amiga platform.

Ultimately, Psygnosis decided to cancel *Neon Vortex* in 1994, just weeks before its planned release. A playable demo was shown at trade shows, and some footage leaked online, but the full game never saw the light of day.

It's become a legendary "lost game" among Amiga enthusiasts, known for its innovative ideas and the unfortunate circumstances that led to its cancellation.
