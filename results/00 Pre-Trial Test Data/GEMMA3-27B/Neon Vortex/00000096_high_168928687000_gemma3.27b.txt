Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Developer:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*)
*   **Platform:** PlayStation (intended for release)
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-style world. The player would have taken on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on-screen, progressing through various levels and engaging in fast-paced action sequences.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was canceled in 1994, reportedly due to technical difficulties with the FMV implementation on the PlayStation hardware. Achieving smooth, high-quality FMV was a challenge at the time.
*   **Footage:** Limited gameplay footage has surfaced online over the years, showcasing the game's visuals and gameplay mechanics. It's quite impressive for its time, even in its unfinished state.

It's become something of a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. There's a lot of interest in seeing a complete version of it someday, but it remains unreleased.
