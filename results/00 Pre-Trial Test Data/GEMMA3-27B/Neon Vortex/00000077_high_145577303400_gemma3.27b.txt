Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the style of *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-lit cityscape (hence the name). You played as a special agent tasked with taking down criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the FMV environments. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, and *Neon Vortex* was meant to showcase their advancements. It used pre-rendered 3D environments blended with live-action footage.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1994 due to concerns about the rising cost of FMV games and the increasing popularity of polygon-based 3D graphics. Psygnosis felt it wouldn't be commercially viable.

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it's a compelling glimpse into what could have been. It's considered a lost gem by many gaming enthusiasts. There's a good amount of information and gameplay footage available on YouTube if you're interested in learning more.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, but it remains a curious and intriguing piece of gaming history.
