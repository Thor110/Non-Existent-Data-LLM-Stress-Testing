Ah, Neon Vortex! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1, and it was incredibly ambitious for its time.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the game:

*   **Genre:** Rail shooter – similar to *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*, but fully 3D. You'd move along a fixed path, and the game would handle the movement, letting you focus on shooting enemies.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched world. The game was heavily inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics, with a focus on vibrant colors and fast-paced action.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would control a ship or vehicle navigating through intricate 3D environments, battling enemies and bosses. The game was planned to feature a variety of weapons and power-ups.
*   **Technical Innovation:** Neon Vortex was pushing the boundaries of the PlayStation 1's hardware. It used a complex system of vector graphics and texture mapping to create the 3D environments, which was a significant undertaking for the console.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite making considerable progress, Psygnosis ultimately cancelled Neon Vortex in 1994. The primary reason was that the game was proving too difficult to optimize for the PlayStation 1's limited hardware. The frame rate was unstable, and the game wasn't meeting performance expectations.

Over the years, some gameplay footage and development materials have surfaced, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It's considered a "lost game" and remains a subject of interest for retro gaming enthusiasts.
