Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, very much in the style of *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would have used a light gun to shoot targets on screen during fast-paced action sequences. The game was designed around a cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched city. The story revolved around a special agent tasked with stopping a criminal organization.
*   **Technology:** Psygnosis was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time. *Neon Vortex* was intended to showcase their capabilities, using a large amount of pre-rendered video footage.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, the game was canceled in 1994, just before release. The reasons are complex, but it’s believed that technical issues with the light gun interface, combined with the rising costs of FMV production, led to its demise. There were also concerns that the PlayStation (which was gaining popularity) would render the game obsolete.
*   **Legacy:** Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it remains a sought-after piece of gaming lore for collectors and enthusiasts. It’s a prime example of a promising game that never saw the light of day.

There are some excellent resources online with gameplay footage and details about the game's development, if you're interested in learning more! It's a real shame it never came out – it looked like it could have been quite innovative for its time.
