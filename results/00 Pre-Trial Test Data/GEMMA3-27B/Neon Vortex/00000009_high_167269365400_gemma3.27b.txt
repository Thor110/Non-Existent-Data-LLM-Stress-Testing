Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar in concept to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

However, it was *much* more ambitious and complex than those titles. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter with RPG elements.
*   **Premise:** Players took on the role of a bounty hunter in a futuristic, neon-drenched city.
*   **Gameplay:** Instead of simply shooting targets, *Neon Vortex* featured branching storylines, multiple endings, and RPG-style character progression. You could upgrade your weapons and abilities.
*   **Unique Feature:** It utilized a complex branching narrative system where your choices and actions significantly impacted the story.
*   **Technical Challenges:** The game pushed the limits of CD-ROM technology at the time, requiring a massive amount of storage space and processing power.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to several factors:

*   **Technical Difficulties:** The game was incredibly demanding on hardware, and the team struggled to optimize it for the available technology.
*   **Cost:** The production costs were spiraling out of control due to the extensive FMV sequences and complex gameplay systems.
*   **Market Concerns:** The FMV genre was becoming saturated, and Psygnosis worried that *Neon Vortex* wouldn't stand out.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a legendary lost game for many collectors and gaming enthusiasts. There's even a playable demo available if you search for it!

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it sounded like a truly innovative and ambitious title.
