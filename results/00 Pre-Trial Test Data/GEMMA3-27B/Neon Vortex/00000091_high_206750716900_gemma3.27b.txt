Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a deep cut into gaming history. It's a fascinating story, as it was a highly anticipated game that never saw the light of day.

*Neon Vortex* was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar in style to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*. However, it was *very* ambitious for its time.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter/Interactive Movie
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired metropolis.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would take on the role of a special agent tasked with stopping a criminal organization. The game was designed around branching storylines and multiple endings based on player choices and shooting accuracy.
*   **Technology:** It was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology, using a large number of pre-rendered video clips and complex branching narratives. It was intended to use the PlayStation's (then-new) CD-ROM capabilities to deliver a cinematic experience.
*   **Unique Feature:** The game was designed to be played with a special, custom-designed light gun that would have provided force feedback and more immersive gameplay.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Several factors contributed to its cancellation. The game suffered from significant technical challenges, particularly with syncing the FMV with gameplay and creating a smooth, responsive experience. The custom light gun was also proving difficult and expensive to manufacture. Psygnosis ultimately decided to cancel the project due to these issues and concerns about the game's viability.

Despite being unreleased, footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a legendary "lost game" in the history of Psygnosis and the PlayStation.

It was a really ambitious project for the time, and it’s a shame it never saw release.
