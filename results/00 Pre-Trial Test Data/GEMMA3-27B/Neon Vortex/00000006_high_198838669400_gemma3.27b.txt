Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Premise:** Players would take on the role of a special agent infiltrating a virtual reality nightclub run by a criminal mastermind. The gameplay revolved around shooting enemies and completing objectives within the VR environment.
*   **Technology:** It was designed to utilize a new, advanced motion capture system for realistic character movements. The game boasted impressive graphics for its time, pushing the limits of CD-ROM technology.
*   **Development:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*) spent a significant amount of time and money on *Neon Vortex*. They even built a dedicated motion capture studio for the project.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being close to completion, Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994. The reasons are complex, but a combination of factors contributed:
    *   **Rising Costs:** FMV games were expensive to produce, and the development costs were spiraling.
    *   **Changing Market:** The gaming landscape was evolving, and Psygnosis shifted its focus towards polygon-based 3D games like *Wipeout XL*.
    *   **Technical Issues:** The motion capture system proved to be unreliable and difficult to integrate seamlessly.
*   **Legacy:** Only a handful of screenshots and a short gameplay demo ever surfaced. *Neon Vortex* remains a legendary unreleased game, a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been.
