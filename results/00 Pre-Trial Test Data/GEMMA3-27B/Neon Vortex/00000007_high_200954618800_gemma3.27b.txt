Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating and mysterious piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis (later known as Studio Liverpool).

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Players would have used a light gun (like the PlayStation GunCon) to shoot at on-screen targets during live-action sequences.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched world (hence the name) filled with cyborgs, gangs, and conspiracies.
*   **Gameplay:** The game was structured around branching storylines and quick-time events. Your actions as a shooter would determine the direction of the narrative.
*   **Story:** You played as a bounty hunter tasked with infiltrating a criminal organization.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology for the time, utilizing extensive pre-rendered video footage and CGI effects.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994, reportedly due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The sheer amount of video footage required was proving difficult to manage on the PlayStation 1's hardware.
*   **High Production Costs:** FMV games were expensive to create, and *Neon Vortex* was ambitious in scope.
*   **Changing Market Trends:** The gaming landscape was shifting, and Psygnosis decided to focus on more traditional 3D games.

**Legacy:**

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it remains a legendary "lost game" among collectors and gaming enthusiasts. It's a prime example of a promising project that never saw the light of day, and a fascinating glimpse into the early days of FMV gaming.
