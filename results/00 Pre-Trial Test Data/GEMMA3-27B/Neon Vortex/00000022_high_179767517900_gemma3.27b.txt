Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter. Think *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a more psychedelic and futuristic aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** The game was set in a bizarre, neon-drenched virtual reality world. The player took on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (like the PlayStation GunCon) to shoot targets on screen, progressing through levels and engaging in quick-time events.
*   **Unique Features:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its ambitious use of CGI and its surreal, visually striking environments. It was aiming for a unique and stylish presentation.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* relatively late in development, reportedly due to concerns about its gameplay being too simplistic and the quality of the FMV sequences. They felt it didn't meet their standards for a flagship PlayStation title.

**Legacy:**

Despite never being released, *Neon Vortex* has become a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts. Footage of the game has surfaced online, and it's considered a fascinating example of a cancelled PlayStation project. It's a prime example of the ambitious, experimental games that were being developed during the early days of the PlayStation era.
