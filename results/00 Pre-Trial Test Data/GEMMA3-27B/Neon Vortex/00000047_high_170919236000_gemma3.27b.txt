Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a unique cyberpunk/noir aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched city filled with crime and intrigue.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through a branching narrative with multiple endings. The story revolved around a detective investigating a conspiracy.
*   **Technology:** It was being developed using pre-rendered 3D graphics overlaid onto full-motion video footage. This was cutting-edge for the time, but also very demanding on hardware.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game in 1994, reportedly due to technical issues and concerns about the PlayStation's ability to handle the complex FMV requirements reliably. It was very close to completion.
*   **Legacy:** Fragments of the game—playable demos and design documents—have surfaced over the years, fueling the interest of gaming historians and collectors. There's a surprisingly robust community dedicated to preserving and analyzing what remains of *Neon Vortex*.

It's considered a "lost game" – a title that was nearly finished but never officially released to the public. It remains a source of fascination for retro gaming enthusiasts.
