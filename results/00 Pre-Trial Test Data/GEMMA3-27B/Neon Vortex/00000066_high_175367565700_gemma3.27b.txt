Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter – think *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with fully pre-rendered, cinematic video sequences instead of polygonal graphics.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk-inspired world. The player takes on the role of a security operative tasked with investigating a mysterious corporation.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets within the FMV sequences. The game was designed to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Unique Features:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its branching narrative. Player choices and shooting accuracy would influence the story and lead to different outcomes. It also featured a distinctive visual style and a moody soundtrack.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* relatively late in development (around 1995) due to several reasons:

*   **Technical Challenges:** FMV games were notoriously difficult to optimize for the PlayStation's hardware. Achieving smooth playback and responsive controls proved to be a significant hurdle.
*   **Rising Costs:** FMV production was expensive, and the costs of creating high-quality video sequences quickly escalated.
*   **Changing Market Trends:** The gaming landscape was shifting towards 3D graphics, and Psygnosis decided to focus on developing more technologically advanced titles.

While never released, gameplay footage and information about *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, making it a well-known "lost game" among collectors and enthusiasts. There's even a playable demo available online if you're curious!



It's a shame it never saw the light of day, as it sounded like a promising and innovative title for its time.
