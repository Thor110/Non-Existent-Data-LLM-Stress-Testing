Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating bit of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk city.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the FMV sequences. The game featured branching paths and multiple endings, depending on the player's choices and accuracy.
*   **Story:** The plot involved a detective investigating a conspiracy in the city, dealing with corrupt corporations and dangerous criminals.
*   **Development:** It was being developed by Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*) for the PlayStation.
*   **Cancellation:** Sadly, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled in 1995, reportedly due to technical challenges with the FMV technology and concerns about the game's overall quality.  The PlayStation wasn't quite powerful enough to deliver the experience Psygnosis envisioned reliably.

Despite being unreleased, some gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It's become something of a cult classic among gaming enthusiasts, known for its ambitious scope and intriguing premise.

You can find some videos of the gameplay on YouTube if you're interested in seeing it in action. It's a shame it never saw the light of day!
