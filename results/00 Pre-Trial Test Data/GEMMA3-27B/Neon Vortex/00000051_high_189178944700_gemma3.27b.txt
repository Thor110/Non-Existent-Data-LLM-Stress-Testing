Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** for the PlayStation 1, developed by Psygnosis in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was going to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a very different aesthetic.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. The player would take on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with eliminating targets in a virtual reality simulation.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun (had it been released) to shoot enemies and interact with the environment presented through pre-rendered full-motion video sequences.
*   **Unique Features:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its ambitious use of FMV, featuring live-action actors and elaborate sets. It aimed for a more cinematic and immersive experience than most light gun games of the time. It was also intended to have branching storylines and multiple endings.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** Creating high-quality FMV sequences was expensive and time-consuming. The PlayStation 1 had limited storage capacity, making it difficult to fit a large amount of video footage onto a single CD-ROM.
*   **Light Gun Availability:** The PlayStation 1 didn't have a dedicated light gun peripheral at the time of development, and Psygnosis was hesitant to release a game that required a specific accessory.
*   **Changing Market Trends:** Psygnosis shifted its focus towards other projects, including the *Wipeout* series and *G-Force*, which were seen as more promising.

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, offering a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a highly sought-after and intriguing piece of unreleased gaming history. You can find videos of it on YouTube if you're interested in seeing what it looked like!
