Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **fully 3D, rail shooter** for the PlayStation 1.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** Rail Shooter – meaning the player's movement was pre-determined along a track, and they focused on aiming and shooting enemies. Think *Star Fox* or *Virtua Cop*, but in full 3D.
*   **Gameplay:** You played as a pilot navigating a futuristic, neon-lit world. The gameplay was fast-paced and heavily focused on shooting down enemies and dodging obstacles. It featured a unique "warp" mechanic to quickly move around the levels.
*   **Visual Style:** The game was known for its striking, vibrant, and heavily stylized visuals. The "neon" in the title was very literal - it was intended to be a very bright and colorful experience.
*   **Technical Innovation:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of what the original PlayStation could do. It was one of the first games attempting to render a truly 3D environment with complex effects.
*   **Cancellation:** Unfortunately, the game was cancelled in 1994 due to technical difficulties and concerns about the PlayStation's hardware limitations. The team couldn't get the game running smoothly enough to meet their standards.

Despite being unreleased, gameplay footage and screenshots have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a legendary "lost game" among PlayStation enthusiasts.
