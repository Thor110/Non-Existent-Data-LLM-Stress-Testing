Ah, *Neon Vortex*! That's a fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but it was ultimately cancelled by Psygnosis before release in 1994.

Here's a breakdown of what it was supposed to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - Think *Sega Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with entirely pre-rendered video footage instead of polygonal graphics.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players took on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets in the video footage, progressing through the story. It was designed to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Technology:** *Neon Vortex* was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, aiming for high-quality video and smooth integration with light gun gameplay.
*   **Cancellation:** The game was cancelled due to a combination of factors, including the increasing cost of FMV production, the limitations of the hardware (specifically, the Amiga 1200), and concerns about the game's overall quality.

Despite never being released, gameplay footage and screenshots of *Neon Vortex* have surfaced over the years, giving us a glimpse of what could have been. It remains a sought-after piece of unreleased gaming history.

It's a great example of an ambitious game that, for various reasons, never saw the light of day.
