Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a distinctly psychedelic and cyberpunk aesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of what it was shaping up to be:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world. Players took on the role of a bounty hunter tracking down criminals.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through levels filled with FMV sequences and action.
*   **Unique Features:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its heavy use of psychedelic visuals, distorted audio, and a non-linear storyline. The game was designed to be disorienting and immersive, aiming for a unique and unsettling experience.
*   **Technology:** It was developed using a proprietary FMV engine and was intended to push the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation 1.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** The game was ambitious for the time, and the FMV technology proved difficult to implement reliably on the PlayStation 1.
*   **Cost:** The production of FMV sequences was expensive and time-consuming.
*   **Marketing Concerns:** Psygnosis feared the game's unconventional visuals and gameplay would be too niche for a mainstream audience.

Only a short playable demo was ever released, and it has become a sought-after piece of gaming ephemera. It's a fascinating "what if" in the history of the PlayStation 1.
