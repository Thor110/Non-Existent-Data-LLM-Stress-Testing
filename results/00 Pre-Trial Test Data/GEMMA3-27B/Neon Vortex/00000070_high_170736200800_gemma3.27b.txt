Ah, *Neon Vortex*! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter** developed by Psygnosis for the PlayStation.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter - similar to *Virtua Cop* or *Time Crisis*, but with a decidedly cyberpunk aesthetic.
*   **Premise:** The player takes on the role of a security operative tasked with stopping a rogue AI that has taken control of a futuristic virtual reality network.
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot targets on screen, progressing through various levels and scenarios within the VR world.
*   **Unique Features:** *Neon Vortex* was notable for its ambitious use of pre-rendered 3D graphics overlaid onto live-action FMV sequences, creating a visually striking (and, for the time, quite advanced) experience.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being nearly complete, the game was cancelled in 1994 due to concerns about its potential for motion sickness and the overall quality of the FMV integration. Psygnosis felt it didn't meet their standards for release.

Footage of *Neon Vortex* has surfaced over the years, and it remains a highly sought-after piece of unreleased gaming history. It's considered a "holy grail" by many collectors and FMV enthusiasts.

It's a shame it never saw the light of day, but it's a fascinating example of the experimental gaming landscape of the mid-90s.
