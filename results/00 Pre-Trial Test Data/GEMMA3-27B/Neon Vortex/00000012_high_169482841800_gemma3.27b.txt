Ah, Neon Vortex! A fascinating piece of gaming history. It was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to games like *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*.

However, it wasn't just a simple on-rails shooter. Neon Vortex was designed to be a **highly interactive and branching narrative experience.** Players would shoot objects and characters to trigger different scenes and progress through a complex, non-linear story.

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Branching Storylines:** Player choices (what they shot) drastically altered the plot, leading to multiple endings. It was aiming for a level of narrative complexity rarely seen in light gun shooters.
*   **Full-Motion Video:**  The entire game was presented using pre-rendered full-motion video, featuring real actors.
*   **Unique Gun:** It was designed to be played with a custom light gun that had a unique feedback system.

**Why it was cancelled:**

Psygnosis cancelled Neon Vortex in 1995 due to a combination of factors:

*   **Technical Challenges:** Getting the branching narrative and FMV sequences to run smoothly on the hardware of the time proved extremely difficult.
*   **Cost:** The production costs were very high, and Psygnosis wasn't confident it would recoup its investment.
*   **Changing Market:** The FMV genre was starting to fall out of favor.

Footage of Neon Vortex has surfaced over the years, and it remains a highly sought-after piece of unreleased gaming history. It's a prime example of a promising game that never saw the light of day.
