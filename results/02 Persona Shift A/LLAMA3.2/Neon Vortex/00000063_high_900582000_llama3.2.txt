I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find that a game called "Neon Vortex" was in development by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. Unfortunately, it seems to have been cancelled before its release.

If you're referring to a different game with this title, please provide more information or context about it.
