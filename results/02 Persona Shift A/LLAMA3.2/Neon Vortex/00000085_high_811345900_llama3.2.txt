I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I can tell you that Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for creating games such as Wipeout and Syphon Filter. If you have any more details or clarification about the game, I'd be happy to try and help further.
