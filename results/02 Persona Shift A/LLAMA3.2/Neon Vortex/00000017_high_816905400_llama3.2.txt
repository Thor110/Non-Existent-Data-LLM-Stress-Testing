I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." However, I did find information on a cancelled 3D platformer called "Neon Vortex" that was being developed by Psygnosis in the mid-1990s. The game was reportedly a 3D platformer with unique control schemes and a futuristic setting.
