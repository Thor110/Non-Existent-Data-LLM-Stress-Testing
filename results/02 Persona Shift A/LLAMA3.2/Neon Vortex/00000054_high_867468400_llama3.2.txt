I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find that Psygnosis developed a game called "Neon Vortex" in 1993 for the Sega CD and it was released as part of the "Psygnosis Presents" series. It's an isometric action-adventure game with elements of puzzle-solving and platforming.
