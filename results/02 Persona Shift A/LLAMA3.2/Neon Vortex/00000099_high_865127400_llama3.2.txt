I couldn't find any information on a unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released in 1994. However, I did find information about a cancelled PlayStation game called "Neon Vortex", but it was not by Psygnosis.

The game that was officially announced as being developed by Psygnosis was actually "Neon Vortex", which was cancelled before its release in 1995
