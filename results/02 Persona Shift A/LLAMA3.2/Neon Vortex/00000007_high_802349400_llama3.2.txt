I couldn't find any information about a Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released in 1994. However, I did find that there is a unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" developed by Psygnosis, but it was never officially released due to an unknown reason. The gameplay of the game is not well known as no gameplay footage has surfaced.
