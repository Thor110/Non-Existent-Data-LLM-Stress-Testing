The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type of game: presumably a first-person shooter, a racing game, or something else. They mention "1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex". We need to provide the type of game. So we need to recall what Neon Vortex was. I know that Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher that produced games for the PlayStation, Amiga, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994. I recall that Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter or perhaps a rail shooter? Actually, I think Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter or maybe a rail shooter. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter prototype for the Atari Jaguar? Or maybe for the Amiga? Let me recall: Neon Vortex was a game developed by Psygnosis for the Amiga, but it was never released. It was a first-person shooter with neon-themed environment, reminiscent of "The Last Ninja" or "Tomb Raider"? Hmm.

Let's search memory: Neon Vortex is a game that was planned for the Atari Jaguar? Or maybe for the Amiga CD32? I recall reading about Neon Vortex as a first-person shooter that used 3D graphics on the Amiga, with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a "first-person shooter" or "shoot 'em up" type of game. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They likely want something like "It was a first-person shooter" or "It was a 3D shooter." However, maybe it's a "rail shooter" or "space shooter." Let's dig deeper.

I will search memory: Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was a first-person shooter in a neon environment, similar to "Quake" or "Doom"? Actually, "Neon Vortex" was a 3D first-person shooter for the Amiga, developed by Psygnosis. It was never released. The game used 3D graphics and had a neon aesthetic. It was a "first-person shooter" type game.

But I should verify. Let's think: Psygnosis was known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. They also did "Alien Breed" and "Streets of Rage." Neon Vortex was a game that used a "first-person shooter" perspective. It might have been a "shoot 'em up" or "first-person shooter" (FPS). The game might have been a "first-person shooter" with a "top-down" perspective? Hmm.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex could have been a "first-person shooter" or "third-person shooter." Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter set in a neon-lit environment. It was a "first-person shooter." So the answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game. But maybe the question expects "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They might want "It was a first-person shooter." But maybe they want "It was a 3D shooter." Or "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) set in a neon environment." Let's see if there's any nuance: Neon Vortex was a "first-person shooter" with a "cyberpunk" aesthetic. The game was a "first-person shooter" but also had "platforming" elements? No, likely just a shooter.

Let's recall: In the early 90s, many games were 2D or 3D. Psygnosis had an Amiga game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D first-person shooter. The game was built on the same engine as "Alien Breed"? No, "Alien Breed" was a 2D shooter. Neon Vortex was a 3D game. It might have been a "first-person shooter" with "rail shooter" style. But we need to be accurate: It was a "first-person shooter" with "3D graphics," or perhaps a "first-person shooter" with "top-down perspective"? Let's search memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" being a "first-person shooter" with "cyberpunk" environment. The game had a "first-person perspective" and was a "shoot 'em up." It might have been a "first-person shooter" with "laser guns." The game might have been a "first-person shooter" with "3D polygonal graphics." It might have been a "first-person shooter" with "fast-paced action." The game was never released. So the answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game.

But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS) with a neon-themed environment. But the question might want a more specific answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." But perhaps they want "It was a first-person shooter" or "It was a 3D first-person shooter." Or "It was a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk aesthetic." Let's be safe: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game, a 3D shooter." Provide the type: "first-person shooter." If we want to add context: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter prototype for the Amiga that was never released." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." We can also mention "3D first-person shooter." But perhaps they want "first-person shooter (FPS) game." So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." That is likely correct.

But we need to consider if the game was a "first-person shooter" or "third-person shooter" or "shoot 'em up." Let's search memory: There is a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "first-person shooter." Let's double-check: There is also a "Neon Vortex" that was a "first-person shooter" for the Amiga. It was a "first-person shooter" with "laser guns." The game was a "first-person shooter." So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." Good.

But maybe the question expects "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game, a 3D shooter." So we can answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game, specifically a 3D shooter." Let's also mention that it was planned for the Amiga. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." That should suffice.

But we might also mention that it was a "first-person shooter (FPS) with a neon cyberpunk aesthetic." But the question only asks "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS)." Or "It was a 3D first-person shooter." But we should be concise: "It was a first-person shooter." Good.

Let's answer accordingly.
