The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type of game: presumably a 3D shooter? I recall Neon Vortex was a planned game by Psygnosis that was canceled. It's a 3D action/first-person shooter? Let's recall: Psygnosis had Neon Vortex, a 3D game for the Sega Saturn? Wait, Psygnosis had many games. Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter that was in development for the Sega Saturn, but never released. It was a first-person shooter with 3D graphics. Or maybe it was a futuristic racing game? Let me recall: Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter that was to be released on the Sega Saturn and PC. It was a first-person shooter with a neon aesthetic. The game was planned as a "first-person shooter" or "action shooter." Let me recall: Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis in 1994, a 3D first-person shooter. It was canceled. It's sometimes referred to as a "first-person shooter" or "FPS." It was going to be a 3D action game. There were also references to it being a "shoot 'em up" or "shooting game." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. Or "a 3D action shooter" or "a 3D shooter." The question might expect: "It was a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn." Or "It was a 3D first-person shooter that combined action with futuristic neon aesthetic." So the answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. Let's verify with knowledge: Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn and PC. It was being developed by Psygnosis, but canceled. The game was set in a neon-lit environment. It was a first-person shooter. The type: first-person shooter (FPS). Some might call it a "3D shooter" or "first-person action game." So the answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. Let me check if there is any nuance: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. Possibly also known as a "first-person shooter." The answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn. I will answer accordingly.

But perhaps the question expects "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game." Or "It was a first-person shooter set in a neon environment." The question is simple: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: It was a first-person shooter (3D).
