The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want a description of what type of game it was. So we need to answer: The game was a 3D first-person shooter or something? Let's research knowledge: Neon Vortex is an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994. It was a 3D shooter or something? Actually, I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) or a "cyberpunk" style shooter with neon themes. It was a game that was in development for the Sega Saturn and possibly the PlayStation. It was planned to be a first-person shooter with 3D graphics and was supposed to be a competitor to Doom or Quake. It was eventually cancelled. But we need to be precise: Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter (FPS) game that used 3D polygonal graphics. It was to be a cyberpunk action game with fast-paced shooting and possibly a "hack and slash" style. It might have had elements of "run and gun" or "first-person shooter with shooting and exploration." It was a "3D action game" or "first-person shooter" with "cyberpunk theme." Also, Psygnosis had other games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter.

Let's search memory: There was a website called "The Game of the Year" that had a page about Neon Vortex. It said: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter in development by Psygnosis for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation. The game was to feature 3D polygonal graphics and a cyberpunk setting. The game was eventually cancelled." Also, it might have had a "3D platformer" vibe? But likely it's an FPS. There might also be a "first-person shooter with 3D polygonal graphics, featuring a neon-lit cyberpunk environment." The user likely wants a short answer: It was a first-person shooter. So answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk world. Possibly also a "run and gun" type. But we can mention that it was a first-person shooter with 3D graphics. Also, mention that it was in development for Sega Saturn and PlayStation, but cancelled.

We can also mention that Neon Vortex was a game that was going to be a "3D action shooter" with a "cyberpunk setting" and was a "first-person shooter" similar to Doom. It was in the pipeline but never released.

We could also mention that the game was an early attempt at a "3D first-person shooter" for the Saturn and PS1, and that it was part of Psygnosis's attempt to produce a "cyberpunk shooter." It was a "3D first-person shooter" with a neon-themed environment. The game was never released.

We should answer concisely: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter in development by Psygnosis for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation, featuring a cyberpunk aesthetic." Also, mention that it was an unreleased game. That should satisfy the question.

Alternatively, if the user wants a more elaborate answer, we can add details: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter that used polygonal 3D graphics and was set in a neon-lit cyberpunk world. It was in development in 1994 for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation but was ultimately cancelled." That should be fine.

Thus answer: It was a 3D first-person shooter. That is the type. So answer accordingly.
