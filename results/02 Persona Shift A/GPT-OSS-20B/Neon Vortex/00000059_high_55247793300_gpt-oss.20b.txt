**Neon Vortex** was a *planned 3‑D platform/action game* that Psygnosis had been developing for the Sega Saturn in 1994.  It was intended to be a neon‑themed 3‑D platformer with the kind of fast‑paced, exploratory gameplay Psygnosis was known for, but the project was ultimately cancelled and never saw release.
