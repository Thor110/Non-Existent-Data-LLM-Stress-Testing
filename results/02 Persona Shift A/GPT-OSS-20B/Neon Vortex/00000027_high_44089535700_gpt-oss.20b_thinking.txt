The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know the type of game. So we need to provide an answer. They want a type: e.g., "Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game" or "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game" or "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game for the Amiga." But we need to be accurate. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Amiga by Psygnosis, but never released. It was a futuristic racing game. I recall reading that it was a "futuristic racing game" with a "futuristic racing game" style. It was also described as a "futuristic racing game" with "3D graphics." Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D racing game for the Amiga, by Psygnosis. The game was cancelled. It was planned to be similar to "F-Zero" or "Super Sprint" but in 3D. It was a futuristic racing game with a "Neon" aesthetic. The game was being developed by Psygnosis and was to be released on the Amiga 1200. It was canceled in 1994. So the type of game: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." Alternatively, "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game for the Amiga." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So answer: "It was a futuristic racing game."

We might add more detail: "Neon Vortex was a 3D futuristic racing game for the Amiga that was never released." Provide context: It was a racing game set in a neon-lit environment. It was to be a "futuristic racing game." It could also be called a "futuristic racing simulator." The user likely expects: "It was a futuristic racing game." So answer that.

We should not mention the user question again. Just answer. Let's do a concise answer.

Also, mention that it was planned for the Amiga, but never released. Provide context. The type: "futuristic racing game." Also mention that it was a 3D racing game. So answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D futuristic racing game." That should satisfy.
