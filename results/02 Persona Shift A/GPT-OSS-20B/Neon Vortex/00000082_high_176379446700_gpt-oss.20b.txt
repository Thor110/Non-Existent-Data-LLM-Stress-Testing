**Neon Vortex was a first‑person shooter.**  

It was a planned 3‑D action game for the Amiga (and the CD32) that Psygnosis had been developing in 1994.  The game was to put the player in a neon‑lit, cyber‑punk environment, fighting enemies from a first‑person perspective with a range of futuristic weapons.  Development was halted—ultimately the project was cancelled after Psygnosis was sold to Sony—so the game never saw a commercial release.
