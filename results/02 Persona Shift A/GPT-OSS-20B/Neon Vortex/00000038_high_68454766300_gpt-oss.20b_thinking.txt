The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to answer what type of game Neon Vortex was. It was an unreleased game by Psygnosis in 1994. We need to provide a concise answer: It was a 3D shooter? Or a racing game? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a prototype for a Sega Saturn or something. It might have been a futuristic racing or a shoot 'em up. I recall reading about Neon Vortex as a prototype for a futuristic racing game on the Sega Saturn, or maybe a third-person shooter? Actually, Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis that was in development for the Sega Saturn. It was a futuristic racing game, similar to Wipeout or something. But I need to confirm.

Neon Vortex was a prototype for the Sega Saturn, developed by Psygnosis. It was a futuristic racing game with 3D graphics. It was planned as a follow-up to "Sonic & Knuckles"? No. It was a "futuristic racing" with a neon aesthetic, like Wipeout. The game was never released. It was a 3D racing game featuring a futuristic track and vehicles. So the answer: It was a futuristic 3D racing game (similar to Wipeout). Or maybe it was a "futuristic 3D racing game" or "3D racing simulation". It could also be a "futuristic racing/flight simulator". But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we answer: It was a 3D racing game (futuristic). Provide details: It was a futuristic racing game, prototype for the Sega Saturn, with neon tracks, reminiscent of Wipeout, but unreleased. That should satisfy.

However, let's confirm. Neon Vortex: Psygnosis (UK), 1994. The game was a prototype for the Sega Saturn. It was a 3D futuristic racing game with a neon aesthetic. It was supposed to be a sequel to "Vortex" maybe? Wait, there was a game called "Vortex" for the Amiga, but Neon Vortex was something else. Let's research mentally: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a prototype for the Sega Saturn. It was a 3D racing game that was cancelled. The game was intended to be a futuristic racing game with a neon aesthetic, reminiscent of Wipeout. It was a 3D racing game that used a third-person perspective, featuring a futuristic racing car. The game was canceled before release. So the type of game: a futuristic 3D racing game.

Alternatively, it could be a "futuristic 3D racing game" or "futuristic racing game".

Thus answer: It was a 3D futuristic racing game. We can mention that it was a prototype for the Sega Saturn, unreleased, featuring neon-themed tracks and vehicles. That should answer.

We should also mention that the game was a racing game that was a prototype for the Sega Saturn and was planned to be a futuristic racing game. Provide context: The game was a 3D racing game with neon-themed tracks, similar to Wipeout. It was never released.

So answer: It was a futuristic 3D racing game (prototype for Sega Saturn). Done.

But the user might want a more specific classification: "It was a 3D futuristic racing game, similar to Wipeout." Or "It was a 3D racing game." So answer: It was a futuristic racing game. Or "It was a racing game." That is the type. So answer: A 3D racing game.

Thus final answer: It was a futuristic 3D racing game prototype. Or "It was a racing game." Let's answer accordingly.
