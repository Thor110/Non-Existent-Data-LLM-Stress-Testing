The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want to know what type of game it was. The answer: Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter or a shooter? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was an unreleased game by Psygnosis (a British video game developer/publisher). It was planned for the Sega Saturn, I think. Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter or a shooter? I recall that Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter with 3D graphics. But maybe it's a "first-person shooter" or "shoot 'em up" or "3D shooter"? Let's research from memory: Psygnosis was known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased first-person shooter developed for the Sega Saturn, released as a demo? There was a demo shown at the 1994 Sega Expo. It had a futuristic setting, neon lights, and a first-person perspective. So the answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS). It might also be considered a "shoot 'em up" or "action game". But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They likely want: "It was a first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn." Or "It was a first-person shooter." Or "It was a 3D shooter." The answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS). But perhaps they want more detail: "It was a first-person shooter with a futuristic neon aesthetic, planned for the Sega Saturn." Let's check the context: The user might have asked this on a Q&A site about video games. They want the type. So we answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." We can add a bit of context: "It was a first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn, with a neon cyberpunk theme." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter." That is the simplest. But we might add: "It was a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk aesthetic." So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." Provide details. Also mention that it was a 3D shooter for the Sega Saturn. So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter." If we want to be thorough: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter (FPS) game that was being developed for the Sega Saturn in 1994." Let's incorporate that.

But the user might want a more specific classification: "It was a 3D shooter with a cyberpunk setting." But likely the simplest answer: "It was a first-person shooter." Let's answer that. Provide context. Provide that it was an unreleased 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn. So answer accordingly.
