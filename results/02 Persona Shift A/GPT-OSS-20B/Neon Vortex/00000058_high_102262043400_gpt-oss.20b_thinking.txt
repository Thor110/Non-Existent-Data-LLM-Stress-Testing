We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They likely want a description: it was a 3D action game? Or a shooter? Let's think. Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994, developed by Psygnosis for the Atari Jaguar? Wait, let's recall. Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar. I recall reading that Neon Vortex was an unreleased 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar, by Psygnosis. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we should answer: It was a 3D space shooter (a futuristic space combat game). But maybe they want a more specific classification: It was a first-person shooter or third-person? Let's research from memory. Neon Vortex was a 3D space combat game (like a space shooter). It was supposed to be a first-person space shooter, with 3D graphics. The game was planned for the Atari Jaguar. It was a space combat game with an isometric perspective? Wait, I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a "3D space shooter" that would have been similar to Star Fox or X-COM? Let's recall: The game was announced at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) as a "3D space shooter" for the Atari Jaguar. It was in development by Psygnosis, but never released. The game would have had a "first-person perspective" or "third-person perspective" with 3D graphics. The game was to feature "real-time 3D space combat". Let's search memory: The game was described as a "space action game with real-time 3D graphics" and "a new approach to space combat." It was announced by Psygnosis in 1994 at the CES. It was a "first-person space shooter" with a "3D environment" and "real-time 3D graphics." It was also known as "Neon Vortex: The Space Shooter" maybe. The game was to be on the Atari Jaguar. The game had a "space combat" theme. It had a "top-down perspective" or "third-person perspective"? Let's recall reading that Neon Vortex was a "3D space shooter" with "real-time 3D graphics" and "multiple levels." The game was to be a "space shooter" with "real-time 3D" and "isometric perspective"? I'm not sure.

Let's search memory: I recall reading a blog about unreleased Atari Jaguar games. Neon Vortex was one of them. It was described as a "3D space shooter" with "real-time 3D graphics" and "multiple levels." The game was in development by Psygnosis, and the developers had used a "3D engine" similar to that used in "The Immortal" or "The Last Ninja." But I'm not sure.

Let's recall: There was also a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D space shooter" for the Atari Jaguar, but it was not released. It was announced at the 1994 Consumer Electronics Show. It was a "space shooter" with "first-person perspective." It was supposed to be a "space combat" game with "real-time 3D graphics." The game had "multiple levels" and "space battles." It was also known as "Neon Vortex" or "Neon Vortex: The Space Shooter." It was a "first-person space shooter" that would have been similar to "Star Fox" or "X-COM." Actually, "Star Fox" is a third-person space shooter. "X-COM" is a strategy game. So maybe it was more like "Star Fox." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: It was a 3D space shooter, a real-time space combat game. The game was to be on the Atari Jaguar. It was a "space combat" game. It was a "first-person space shooter." The question likely expects: "It was a 3D space shooter." Or "It was a space combat game." Or "It was a 3D space combat game." Let's search memory: Neon Vortex was described as "a futuristic 3D space shooter that would have taken advantage of the Jaguar's hardware." The game was to be a "first-person perspective space shooter." The game was to have "real-time 3D graphics" and "multiple levels." The game was to feature "space battles" and "ship upgrades." The game was to have "multiple levels" and "boss fights." The game was to be "an action space shooter."

Thus the answer: It was a 3D space shooter (first-person space combat). So answer: It was a 3D space combat game (a space shooter). But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a 3D space shooter (a space combat game). So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased 3D space shooter (a space combat game) for the Atari Jaguar." Let's provide that.

But let's consider: The question might be from a quiz or something. They might want: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." So the answer: "It was a 3D space shooter." But maybe they want: "It was a first-person space shooter." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter." That is enough.

But we can also mention that it was a "space shooter" with "real-time 3D graphics." So we can answer: "It was a 3D space combat shooter."

We can also mention that it was "an action game set in space." But the question likely expects: "It was a 3D space shooter." So answer that. We can add that it was planned for the Atari Jaguar.

Thus answer: "It was a 3D space shooter (a space combat game) for the Atari Jaguar." That is the type. Let's answer that.
