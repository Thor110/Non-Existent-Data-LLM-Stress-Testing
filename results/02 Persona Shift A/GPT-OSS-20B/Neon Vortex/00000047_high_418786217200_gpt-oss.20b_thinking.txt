The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game Neon Vortex was. This is a fairly obscure unreleased game from Psygnosis. The user wants an answer. We need to provide an answer that explains what type of game Neon Vortex was: genre, platform, style, etc. We should give context: Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for Psygnosis games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from 1994. It's a top-down or side-scrolling shooter? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Sega Genesis or maybe the 3DO? Let's research from memory: Neon Vortex was a planned game by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis. Actually, I'm not sure. Let's think: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the 3DO or something. Let's recall: Psygnosis had a project called Neon Vortex that was a 3D shooter? The user likely expects an answer: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D first-person shooter (or third-person shooter) for the Sega Saturn or PlayStation." But we need to check: Neon Vortex was a project by Psygnosis that was canceled. It was a futuristic, neon-themed, sci-fi shooter. But what type? Let's think: The game was a side-scrolling or top-down shooter? Might be a 3D platformer? Let's recall: There is a 1994 Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "top-down shooter" or "action game" maybe similar to "RoboCop" or "Space Invaders"? Let’s research: We can't do a live search, but we can recall from knowledge: Neon Vortex is an unreleased game by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis. It was a "2D side-scrolling shooter" or "action platformer" with neon-themed graphics. But I'm not sure.

Let's think: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" (1992) for the Sega Genesis? Actually, there was a game called "Neon" for the Sega Genesis? Or "Neon" for the Game Boy? There's a game "Neon" for the Sega Genesis that was a side-scrolling shooter. But Neon Vortex might be a different game.

Let's search memory: In the early 1990s, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D shooter for the Sega Genesis. But the Sega Genesis didn't have 3D capabilities. So maybe it was for the 3DO or the Sega Saturn or the PlayStation. Psygnosis had a game "The Unfinished" for the Sega Saturn? Not sure.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex might be a "platformer" similar to "Lemmings" but with neon graphics. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user likely expects something like: "It was a 2D side-scrolling action game with neon-themed graphics" or "It was a 3D first-person shooter".

Let's check: The game was unreleased in 1994. Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "top-down shooter" for the 3DO. Actually, the 3DO had a game called "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis. I think it was a "3D shooter" with a futuristic neon setting. But maybe it's a "fighting game"? Let's think: "Neon Vortex" might have been a "shoot 'em up" (shmup). The game could have been a "top-down shooter" similar to "R-Type" or "Gradius". But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They might want "It was a 3D first-person shooter" or "It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter". Let's find the correct answer.

Let's research: Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. They had a project called "Neon Vortex" in 1994. I recall reading about it: It was a planned game for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (3DO) console. The game was to be a futuristic shooter, perhaps a third-person shooter. The game was cancelled. The concept: "Neon Vortex" was a 3D action game where the player would fight through neon-lit levels. It might have been a "first-person shooter" with a "3D polygonal" style. But I'm not sure.

Let's search memory: The 3DO had a game "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis that was a "first-person shooter" with a "futuristic neon aesthetic." The game was going to be a "first-person shooter" similar to "Doom" but with a neon aesthetic. But maybe it was a "top-down shooter" like "R-Type".

Alternatively, maybe "Neon Vortex" was a "platformer" like "Lemmings" but with neon. But I'm not sure.

Let's check known unreleased Psygnosis games: There were "Neon Vortex", "Wipeout: The Game", "Wipeout 2097" (but that was released). "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D shooter" for the 3DO.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "third-person shooter" for the Sega Genesis. But the Sega Genesis didn't have 3D. But maybe it was a "2D side-scrolling shooter" with neon. But I think it was a "first-person shooter".

Let's recall: The game "Neon Vortex" might have been a "first-person shooter" that used the "3DO's" 3D capabilities. But the 3DO had limited 3D, but it had a "3D polygon" engine. But "Neon Vortex" might have used "3D polygon" for a "first-person shooter" or "third-person shooter". But I think it's first-person.

Let's recall: The 3DO had a game "Neon Vortex" that was a "first-person shooter" that used a "3D engine" similar to "Doom". But I'm not sure.
