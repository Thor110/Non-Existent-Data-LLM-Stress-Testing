**Neon Vortex was a planned 3‑D space‑shoot‑em‑up.**  
Developed by Psygnosis in 1994 for the Atari Jaguar, it was meant to be a top‑down/first‑person shooter featuring a neon‑styled spaceship that could fly through a 3‑D environment and blast enemies. The project was cancelled before it ever saw the light of day.
