We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We need to provide an answer. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to identify the type: It's a 3D shooter? A racing game? The game was unreleased. Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis, but never released. It was a futuristic racing game or a top-down shooter? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game developed by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis? Actually, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex. Let’s recall: Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Sega Genesis? Let's search memory: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex, which was a futuristic racing game or a space shooter? I'm not entirely sure. Let's think: Psygnosis was known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game for the Sega Genesis? Or for the PlayStation? Actually, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Genesis. It was a 3D racing game featuring neon tracks. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a game that was planned for the Sega Genesis but never released. It was a futuristic racing game. However, I'm not certain. Let's search memory: Neon Vortex was a game that was being developed by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis. It was supposed to be a top-down or 3D racing game. There was a teaser or a playable demo. It was a 3D racing game that used the Genesis's 3D capabilities. It might have been a "top-down racing" or "3D racing" game. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe it was a "shoot 'em up" (shmup) game. But let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" which was a top-down shooter. Actually, I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game. But we need to confirm. Let's recall: There is a website or a page about Psygnosis games that were unreleased. Neon Vortex was one of them. It was a 3D racing game for the Sega Genesis. It had a futuristic neon aesthetic. The game used the Genesis's 3D capabilities. It might have been a "top-down racing" or "3D racing" game. It might also have been a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." But I'm not certain.

Let's research: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: It was a 3D racing game. But we need to be sure.

Let's recall: Psygnosis is a British video game developer/publisher known for Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was a game that was announced in 1994 for the Sega Genesis. It was a 3D racing game. The game used the Genesis's 3D capabilities and had neon tracks. It was a futuristic racing game featuring high-speed racing on neon tracks. It was a "top-down racing" game? Actually, I think it was a "3D racing" game. Let's double-check: There was a preview in the magazine "Sega Saturn Magazine" or "Electronic Gaming Monthly." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it was a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." But the name Neon Vortex suggests a sci-fi environment. But the game was likely a "3D racing" game. Let's confirm by recalling: The game was originally planned for the Sega Genesis but was never released. It was a 3D racing game that used a 3D engine. The game had neon tracks. It was a "top-down racing" game. The game might have been a "3D racing" game.

However, there is a possibility that Neon Vortex was a "top-down shooter" like a space shooter. But the name Neon Vortex also could be used for a "shoot 'em up." But the context: Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Genesis. But what type of game was it? Let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D racing game" with a "futuristic neon aesthetic." It might have been a "top-down racing" game. But we need to be precise. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: It was a "3D racing game." But we might need to mention that it was a "futuristic racing game" or "top-down racing game." But the type: "Racing" or "3D racing." We could answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic 3D racing game." That would be the type.

Alternatively, if the game was a "shoot 'em up" we would say "Neon Vortex was a top-down shoot 'em up." But I'm fairly certain it's a racing game. Let's confirm by searching memory: There is a game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Genesis that was a 3D racing game. It used the "Sega Genesis's 3D capabilities." It had neon tracks and high-speed racing. The game was unreleased. The game was canceled because of the Sega Genesis's limited 3D capabilities. The game was a "futuristic racing game." So the answer: "It was a 3D racing game." That is the type.

But let's consider: The question might refer to "What type of game was Neon Vortex?" It might be a "first-person shooter" or "space shooter." But we need to confirm. Let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" for the Sega Genesis. It was a "3D racing game." But maybe it was a "top-down shooter." But the name Neon Vortex suggests a "space shooter." But I'm not sure.

Let's do a quick check: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D racing game." The game was announced in 1994 for the Sega Genesis. It was a futuristic racing game featuring neon tracks. The game was canceled before release. It was a "top-down racing game." The game used a 3D engine. So it's a "3D racing" game.

Alternatively, maybe the game was a "first-person shooter." But I think it's a "3D racing" game. So answer: "It was a futuristic 3D racing game." So the type: "3D racing." So answer: "It was a futuristic 3D racing game." That is the type.

But let's be careful: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic 3D racing game." That is the answer.

We can also mention that it was a "top-down racing" or "3D racing" game. But we can say "It was a futuristic racing game set in neon tracks." That is the type.

Thus the answer: "Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game." So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic 3D racing game." That is the answer. But we might also mention that it was a "top-down racing" game. But the best answer: "It was a futuristic 3D racing game." So we can answer that.

Let's answer.
