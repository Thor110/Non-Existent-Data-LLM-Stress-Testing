We need to answer the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The question is asking about a game that was unreleased, from 1994, made by Psygnosis, called Neon Vortex. We need to identify what type of game it was. We need to recall or research knowledge: Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. In 1994, they had a project called Neon Vortex. I recall that Neon Vortex was a planned game for the 3DO or something? Actually, Neon Vortex was a planned 3D shooter or something? Let's recall: Psygnosis had a project called Neon Vortex for the 3DO, a futuristic first-person shooter? Or was it a space shooter? Let's search memory: There was a game called Neon Vortex for the 3DO and Sega Saturn that was planned but canceled. It was a 3D shooter with a neon aesthetic. Or perhaps it was a side-scrolling shooter? Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter planned for the 3DO by Psygnosis, but it was canceled. It was supposed to be a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk vibe. There's also a possibility that Neon Vortex was a space-themed shoot 'em up for the 3DO. Actually, I think Neon Vortex was a planned 3D first-person shooter for the 3DO and Sega Saturn, featuring a cyberpunk setting, with a neon aesthetic. It was also referred to as a "3D shooter" or "first-person shooter." But maybe it was a "first-person shooter" or "3D shooter" or "shoot 'em up." Let's research memory: In the 90s, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a first-person shooter, but it was canceled. The game was also known as "Neon Vortex: The Game" or "Neon Vortex: The Space Shooter." The design was by Psygnosis, with a futuristic setting. It might have been a "cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter." It might have been a "first-person shooter" with a "cyberpunk" aesthetic. But we need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to provide a type: e.g., "It was a first-person shooter" or "It was a 3D shooter" or "It was a cyberpunk first-person shooter" or "It was a space-themed first-person shooter" or "It was a sci-fi shooter." The question likely expects "It was a 3D first-person shooter" or "It was a cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter." Let's see if there is any other type: It might have been a "3D shooter" or "first-person shooter." We can also mention that it was planned as a "first-person shooter" for the 3DO and Sega Saturn. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter." But maybe the game was a "shoot 'em up" or "space shooter." Let's search memory: There was also a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "top-down shooter" for the 3DO. Actually, I recall reading about a canceled game "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D shooter" for the 3DO. The game was to be a "first-person shooter" with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The game was planned by Psygnosis, but it was never released. It was rumored to be a "3D shooter." So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter." Alternatively, if we want to be more specific: "It was a cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter." Or "It was a 3D first-person shooter." Or "It was a sci-fi first-person shooter." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the simplest answer: "It was a first-person shooter." But maybe the answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter." Let's consider: The type of game could also be "a 3D shooter" or "a futuristic 3D shooter." The question might be from someone reading about the game and wanting to know the type. They might want to know if it was a shooter, a platformer, a puzzle game, etc. So we need to answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter (a cyberpunk-themed shooter)." That is the type. Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a planned first-person shooter for the 3DO and Sega Saturn, with a cyberpunk aesthetic. The game was canceled. It was a "first-person shooter" or "3D shooter." So answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter." We can mention that it was a cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter. That is the type. Let's answer: "Neon Vortex was a cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter (a 3D shooter) that Psygnosis had been developing for the 3DO and Sega Saturn in 1994." That should satisfy. Let's also mention that it was a "first-person shooter." So answer: "It was a first-person shooter." That is the type. Let's provide that.
