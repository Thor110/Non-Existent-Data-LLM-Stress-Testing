The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game it was. So we need to answer: It was a futuristic rail shooter or a first-person shooter? Let's recall Neon Vortex. Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis (now Psygnosis) that was unreleased. It was a 3D shooter? Let's search memory. Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D first-person shooter or a rail shooter set in a cyberpunk environment. It was originally developed for the Amiga? Or perhaps for the PC? Actually, I recall that Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D first-person shooter, similar to "Doom" or "Quake", but with a cyberpunk setting. It was unreleased. It was a 3D shooter that used a pseudo-3D engine like "Doom" or "Quake"? Let's think.

The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want to know the genre. Likely a first-person shooter. But we need to confirm. There's also a possibility that it's a "first-person shooter" or "3D action shooter" or "rail shooter" or "shoot 'em up" or "first-person shooter with a futuristic setting". But the correct answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS).

But we should verify. Let's recall that Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, and others. They also had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D shooter. According to some sources, it was an unreleased first-person shooter for the PC and Amiga, featuring a cyberpunk setting and a "Doom-like" engine. It was canceled around 1994 due to budget constraints or other reasons. It was planned to be a futuristic shooter.

Let's search memory: I recall reading about Neon Vortex on the website "GameFAQs" or "MobyGames". It might have a description: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter for the Amiga and PC, featuring a cyberpunk environment." Another source: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk world, using a pseudo-3D engine similar to the one used in Doom."

Or "It was a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk aesthetic." Let's see.

It might have had a "3D shooter" engine like "Doom." The game might have been planned for the Amiga and PC. It might have used the "Doom engine." But let's confirm.

Let's double-check if there's any nuance: Some sources might describe Neon Vortex as a "first-person shooter" or "first-person shooter with a cyberpunk setting."
