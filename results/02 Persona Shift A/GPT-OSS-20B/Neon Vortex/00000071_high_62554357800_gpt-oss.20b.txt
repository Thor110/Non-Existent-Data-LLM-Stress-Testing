**Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game.**  

Developed by Psygnosis in 1994 for the Atari Jaguar, it was meant to be an arcade‑style racing title with neon‑lit tracks and high‑speed action. The game’s concept revolved around racing futuristic vehicles through stylised, neon‑bright courses, rather than being a shooter, platformer, or puzzle game.
