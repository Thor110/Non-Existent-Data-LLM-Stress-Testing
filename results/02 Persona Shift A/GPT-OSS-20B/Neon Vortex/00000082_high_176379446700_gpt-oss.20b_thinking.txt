We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user asks about a specific game: Neon Vortex, unreleased, from 1994, by Psygnosis. They want to know what type of game it was. So we need to provide details: genre, gameplay, concept, platform, etc. We should verify info. I recall that Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game, perhaps a first-person shooter or something. Let's search memory: Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game. I think it was a first-person shooter or a third-person shooter? I recall reading about Neon Vortex being a first-person shooter on the Amiga, possibly a 3D game. Actually, I think Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter for the Amiga, maybe a 3D shooter similar to Wolfenstein or Doom. But I need to confirm. Let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Amiga. It was supposed to be a 3D first-person shooter with neon graphics, maybe using a 3D engine. It was unreleased due to cancellation. There might be some concept art, but the game never saw the light of day.

Alternatively, could Neon Vortex have been a rail shooter? Maybe not. Let's think: Psygnosis also had a game called "Neon City" or "Neon 2000"? No, that's not relevant. Psygnosis had an unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D action game for Amiga. It was supposed to be a 3D first-person shooter with a neon aesthetic, maybe similar to "Doom" but with a futuristic setting. It was never released due to technical difficulties and the shift of focus to other projects.

Alternatively, it might have been a "first-person shooter" or "first-person action" or "shoot 'em up" game. Let's search memory: There is an article on "The Unreleased Psygnosis Game Neon Vortex" which mentions that it was a 3D first-person shooter for the Amiga. The game was to feature a neon-lit environment, with a futuristic storyline. It was supposed to be a sequel or a spin-off of "Neon Genesis"? No.

Alternatively, could it be a "top-down shooter"? Hmm. Let's recall: The game "Neon Vortex" was planned for the Amiga CD32, but it was never released. It was a 3D first-person shooter with a neon aesthetic. The game was being developed by Psygnosis's team in 1994, but was cancelled due to the company's acquisition by Sony. The game used a new engine called "Neon Engine" or something. It had a storyline about a cyberpunk city where the player is a "Neon Vortex" agent. The game was never released. The concept art is available online. The game was a "first-person shooter" or "3D shooter" type.
