Neon Vortex was a **3‑D first‑person shooter** in the cyber‑punk vein.  Developed by Psygnosis in 1994 for the Sega Saturn (and later the PlayStation), the game was meant to feature fully polygonal 3‑D graphics and a neon‑lit, high‑tech setting, but it was ultimately cancelled and never saw release.
