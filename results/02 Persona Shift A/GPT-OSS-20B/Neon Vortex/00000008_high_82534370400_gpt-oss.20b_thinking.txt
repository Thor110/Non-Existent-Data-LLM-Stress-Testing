We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We need to answer what type of game it was. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a 3D action/first-person shooter? Wait, let's recall. Neon Vortex was an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994. I recall reading about it. Neon Vortex was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar or maybe the 3DO? Wait, let's think. Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. In the early 90s, they had a project called Neon Vortex. It was a 3D first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk setting, perhaps. But I need to confirm. Let’s research memory. Neon Vortex was a game planned for the Atari Jaguar. Actually, I think Neon Vortex was a planned 3D shooter for the Atari Jaguar. It was a 3D first-person shooter with a neon cyberpunk aesthetic. It was canceled and never released. It was a first-person shooter (FPS) with 3D graphics, possibly similar to Doom. But also could be a rail shooter. Let's recall: I think Neon Vortex was a 3D action game, perhaps a rail shooter like Virtua Cop or something. But we need to be accurate. Let's recall the game from memory: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D shooter for the Atari Jaguar. It was announced at the 1994 Summer Consumer Electronics Show (CES) maybe. It was a first-person shooter with a neon cyberpunk setting, featuring a single-player campaign where you fight enemies. The game was to be developed by Psygnosis. It was canceled in 1995. It was a 3D first-person shooter with a futuristic setting. So the answer: It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was a first-person shooter. But maybe the question expects "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter game." Or "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game for the Atari Jaguar." The question is asking "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "Neon Vortex was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." However, we should verify that Neon Vortex was indeed a first-person shooter. Let's recall the details: Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter developed by Psygnosis for the Atari Jaguar. It was supposed to be a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk setting, featuring a neon-lit environment. It was planned to be a 3D action game similar to Doom or Quake. It was canceled in 1995. It was never released. So the type of game: 3D first-person shooter. Alternatively, it could be a rail shooter. But I'm not sure. Let's search memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" being a "first-person shooter" on the Atari Jaguar. It had a "cyberpunk" aesthetic. It was a "3D action" game. But to be safe, we can answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter." Or "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." If the question expects more detail, we could mention that it was a 3D action shooter with a cyberpunk setting, developed for the Atari Jaguar but never released. But the question only asks "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." If we want to be more specific: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter for the Atari Jaguar." So the answer: "It was a first-person shooter (FPS) game." Let's answer concisely: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first‑person shooter game." But maybe the question expects "Neon Vortex was a 3D action/first-person shooter." So we can answer: "It was a first‑person shooter (FPS) game." But we can also mention that it was a 3D action game. Let's answer: "It was a 3D first‑person shooter (FPS)." That should suffice. However, the question might want "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter (FPS) for the Atari Jaguar." So we can answer that. Let's do that.
