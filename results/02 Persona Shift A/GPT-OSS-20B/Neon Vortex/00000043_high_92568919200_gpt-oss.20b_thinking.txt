The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game Neon Vortex was. We need to answer. The user is presumably looking for a description: genre, style, platform, etc. We need to provide a concise answer. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want to know: what type of game was Neon Vortex? So presumably it's a side-scrolling shooter? Or maybe a space shooter? Or an action game? I recall that Neon Vortex was an unreleased game by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis, a 2D side-scrolling shooter. It was a game that was canceled. It was a side-scrolling shooter. It was a 2D action platformer. The user might want to know the genre: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shooter" or "Neon Vortex was a platform shooter" or "Neon Vortex was a 2D action game". But maybe they want more detail: It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, featuring a futuristic setting, reminiscent of games like Super R-Type. It's also known as "Neon Vortex: The Return of the Vortex". But I'm not sure. Let's research. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So maybe they want to know: "It was a side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, similar to games like R-Type and Ikaruga." Or maybe "It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shooter (shoot 'em up) that was being developed for the Sega Genesis by Psygnosis in 1994, but it was never released." That would be the answer. But maybe they want more context: "Neon Vortex was a side-scrolling shoot 'em up game set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment." Or "It was a 2D shooter with a neon aesthetic." Let's see if there's more. There is an article on MobyGames: Neon Vortex, 1994, unreleased, Psygnosis. The game was a 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis. The gameplay was similar to R-Type. The game had a neon aesthetic. The game was canceled due to the collapse of Psygnosis. But let's confirm: Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. They had a canceled game called Neon Vortex. It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter. It's also known as "Neon Vortex: The Return of the Vortex." The game was in development for the Sega Genesis. The game was to be a side-scrolling shooter. So the answer: "It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter (shoot 'em up) for the Sega Genesis." That should answer the question.

But maybe the user wants to know what type of game it was in terms of genre: "shoot 'em up" or "side-scrolling shooter." The user might also want to know if it was a platformer or a shooter. So answer: "Neon Vortex was a side-scrolling shooter (a shoot 'em up)."

We can also mention that it was a 2D side-scrolling shooter with a neon aesthetic and a cyberpunk vibe, reminiscent of games like R-Type. So we can say: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shooter (shoot 'em up) for the Sega Genesis, set in a futuristic neon environment."

Alternatively, the user might want to know if it was a platform game, an action game, a racing game, etc. But it's a side-scrolling shooter. So answer accordingly.

Let's provide a concise answer: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up (a shooter) for the Sega Genesis." That should suffice.

We can also mention that the game was a side-scrolling shooter similar to R-Type, but never released. So the answer: "It was a side-scrolling shooter." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a side-scrolling shooter." Provide context: "It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, featuring neon aesthetics and a futuristic setting." That should answer.

We should also mention that it was a 2D side-scrolling shooter. Possibly also a platform shooter. But the main thing: side-scrolling shooter.

Thus answer: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up for the Sega Genesis." That is the answer. Provide a short explanation: "It was a side-scrolling shooter game that never saw release." That should satisfy the user.
