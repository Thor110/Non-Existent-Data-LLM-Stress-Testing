**Neon Vortex was a futuristic 3‑D racing game.**  

The project was a high‑speed, neon‑lit racing title that Psygnosis had planned for the 1994 era (initially slated for the Atari Jaguar/32X family). It was never released, but its core gameplay was centered on racing through stylized, neon‑driven tracks.
