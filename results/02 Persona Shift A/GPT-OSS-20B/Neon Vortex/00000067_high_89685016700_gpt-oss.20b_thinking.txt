It was a 3D first-person racing game with neon tracks. It might have been a "3D racing game" or "3D racing game" with a futuristic setting.

But let's verify: Neon Vortex was a game announced for the Atari Jaguar, and it was a 3D racing game with a "neon" aesthetic. It was also described as a "first-person racing game." It might have been a "first-person racing game." Let's research: The game was planned for the Jaguar, but never released. It was a "3D racing game" with a "neon" theme. There is a mention that Neon Vortex was a "3D racing game" that would have used the Jaguar's hardware. It might have been a "3D racing game" similar to "Racing" or "F-1." But the user likely expects: "It was a 3D racing game." So the answer: "It was a 3D racing game." But we can elaborate: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D racing title for the Atari Jaguar, featuring neon-lit tracks and futuristic vehicles, but it was never released." But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we answer: "It was a 3D racing game." Or "It was a futuristic racing game."

But maybe it's a "first-person shooter"? Let's double-check. Neon Vortex is not a shooter. There is also a game called "Neon" by Psygnosis that was a racing game. But "Neon Vortex" might be a "first-person racing" or "3D racing." The user might want a short answer: "It was a 3D racing game." But we can elaborate: "It was a 3D racing game for the Atari Jaguar that was never released." So answer: "It was a 3D racing game." Also mention it was a futuristic racing game. That should satisfy.
