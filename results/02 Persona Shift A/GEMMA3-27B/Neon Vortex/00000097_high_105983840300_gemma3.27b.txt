Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the genre from the results.  This is a bit fragile, but aims for a concise answer.
genre = None
if 'answer_box' in results and 'text' in results['answer_box']:
    genre = results['answer_box']['text'].strip()
elif 'featured_snippet' in results and 'text' in results['featured_snippet']:
    genre = results['featured_snippet']['text'].strip()
else:
    # Fallback: look for it in the first result's text.  Less reliable.
    if 'organic_results' in results and len(results['organic_results']) > 0:
        genre = results['organic_results'][0]['snippet'].strip()


print(genre)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter** game. It was intended to be a fully 3D rail shooter, similar to *Star Fox* on the SNES, but with full polygonal graphics and a focus on speed and intense action. It was notable for being quite ambitious for the time, aiming for a very fast-paced experience on the PlayStation 1.
