Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the information from the search results.  This is a bit fragile,
# as website structures change, but a good starting point.
genre = None
try:
    for result in results['answer_box']:
        if "genre" in result['text'].lower():
            genre = result['text'].split(":")[1].strip()
            break
    if genre is None:
        for result in results['featured_snippet']:
            if "genre" in result['text'].lower():
                genre = result['text'].split(":")[1].strip()
                break
except:
    genre = None #In case the search results don't have the expected format

print(genre)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter** game. It was intended to be a futuristic, vector-graphics based shooter, similar in style to *Star Fox* on the SNES, but using polygonal graphics. It was planned for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn.
