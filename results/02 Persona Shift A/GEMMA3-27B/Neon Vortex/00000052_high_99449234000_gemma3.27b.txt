Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game, *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract information from the search results.  We're looking for a concise description of the genre.
genre_info = ""
try:
    for result in results["answer_box"]:
        if "genre" in result["text"].lower():
            genre_info = result["text"]
            break # Take the first result that mentions genre.
    if not genre_info:
        for result in results["featured_snippet"]:
            if "genre" in result["text"].lower():
                genre_info = result["text"]
                break
except:
    genre_info = "Information not found."


print(genre_info)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter** (specifically, a "virtual reality rail shooter"). It was intended to be a showcase for the upcoming Sega VR headset, but the game and the headset were both cancelled. It's also described as having elements of an on-rails light gun shooter, but with a focus on vector graphics and a psychedelic aesthetic.
