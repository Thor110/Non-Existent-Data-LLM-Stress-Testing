Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

#print(results) #Useful for debugging - see what the API returned

try:
    answer = results['answer_box']['text']
    print(answer)
except:
    answer = results['knowledge_graph']['about']
    print(answer)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter**, specifically a **virtual reality rail shooter**. It was intended to be one of the first games to heavily utilize the then-emerging VR technology, and used a special headset. It was cancelled due to technical difficulties with the headset and the game itself.
