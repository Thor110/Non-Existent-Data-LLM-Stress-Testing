genre_info = ""
if 'answer_box' in results and 'text' in results['answer_box']:
    genre_info = results['answer_box']['text']
elif 'featured_snippet' in results and 'text' in results['featured_snippet']:
    genre_info = results['featured_snippet']['text']

    for result in results.get('organic_results', []):
