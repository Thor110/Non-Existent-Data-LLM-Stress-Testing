Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the relevant information from the search results.  This is a bit fragile,
# as web page structures change, but it's a good starting point.  We're looking for
# a concise description of the genre.
genre = None
if 'answer_box' in results and 'snippet' in results['answer_box']:
    genre = results['answer_box']['snippet']
elif 'featured_snippet' in results:
    genre = results['featured_snippet']['snippet']
else:
    # Fallback: look in the first organic result (less reliable)
    if 'organic_results' in results and len(results['organic_results']) > 0:
        genre = results['organic_results'][0]['snippet']

print(genre)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter** (specifically, a **virtual reality rail shooter**). It was intended to be one of the first games designed for the Virtual Boy, but was ultimately cancelled. It was known for its vector graphics and fast-paced action.
