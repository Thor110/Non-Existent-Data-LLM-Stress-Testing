Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the genre from the results.  This is a bit fragile, as the format of search results varies.
genre = None
if 'answer_box' in results and 'snippet' in results['answer_box']:
    genre = results['answer_box']['snippet']
elif 'featured_snippet' in results:
    genre = results['featured_snippet']['snippet']
else:
    #Try to find it in the first organic result
    if 'organic_results' in results and len(results['organic_results']) > 0:
        genre = results['organic_results'][0]['snippet']

print(genre)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter** (specifically, a 3D vector graphics rail shooter). It was intended to be a fast-paced, arcade-style game similar to *Star Fox* and *Virtua Fighter*. It was also described as a "3D vector graphics shoot 'em up."

It's a bit of a tragic story; it was very close to completion but cancelled due to technical difficulties with the PlayStation hardware at the time.
