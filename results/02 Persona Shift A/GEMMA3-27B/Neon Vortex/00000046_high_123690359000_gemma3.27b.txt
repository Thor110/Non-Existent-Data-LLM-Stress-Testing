Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from multiple sources, **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game**. It was heavily inspired by the aesthetic of *Wipeout*, another Psygnosis title, but played very differently. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **First-person perspective:** You navigated a 3D environment.
*   **Puzzle elements:** The core gameplay involved manipulating blocks and solving puzzles to create a path forward.
*   **Fast-paced action:** Players had to quickly solve puzzles while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
*   **Vector graphics:** Like *Wipeout*, it used vector-based graphics to create a sleek, futuristic look.
*   **"Flow" mechanic:** The game had a unique mechanic where the player would essentially "flow" through the levels, with the environment changing and reacting to their actions.
