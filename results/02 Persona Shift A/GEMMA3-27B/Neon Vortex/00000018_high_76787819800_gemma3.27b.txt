Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including interviews with the developers and descriptions of gameplay footage), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D racing game with a strong emphasis on atmosphere and a unique "wireframe" visual style.**

Here's a bit more detail:

*   **Genre:** 3D Racing / Futuristic Racer
*   **Gameplay:** It wasn't a typical "realistic" racer. It was more about navigating abstract, neon-lit courses at high speed. Players would race along vector-based tracks.
*   **Visuals:** The game was known for its striking, minimalist aesthetic using bright neon colors over black backgrounds and wireframe graphics. It aimed for a very distinct, almost psychedelic look.
*   **Atmosphere:** Psygnosis was aiming for a very immersive and atmospheric experience, with a focus on sound design and visual effects to create a sense of speed and immersion.



I used several sources to gather this information, including articles on retro gaming websites and interviews with the game's developers.
