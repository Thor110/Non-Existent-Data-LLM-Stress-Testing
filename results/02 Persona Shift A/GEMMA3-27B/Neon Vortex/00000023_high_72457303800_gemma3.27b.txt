Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including gaming news sites and retro gaming databases), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game.** 

Here's a breakdown of what's known:

*   **Genre:** Primarily a 3D puzzle game, with elements of action and a focus on navigating abstract, neon-lit environments.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a small ship or probe through a series of increasingly complex, maze-like levels. The goal involved manipulating the environment, solving puzzles, and avoiding obstacles. It was described as having a similar feel to *Stunt Car Racer* (another Psygnosis title) but with a focus on puzzle-solving rather than racing.
*   **Visuals:** The game was notable for its vibrant, neon-infused graphics and use of early 3D polygonal rendering. It aimed for a futuristic, psychedelic aesthetic.

Unfortunately, *Neon Vortex* was never officially released. Psygnosis cancelled the project relatively late in development, and a playable demo is all that remains.
