Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from multiple sources (including interviews with the developers and previews from the time), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle-action game, often described as a mix between *Marble Madness* and *Wipeout*.**

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay:

*   **Ball-based:** You controlled a ball rolling through intricate, futuristic 3D courses.
*   **Speed & Momentum:** Similar to *Wipeout*, speed and maintaining momentum were crucial.
*   **Puzzle Elements:** The courses weren't just about speed, but also about solving puzzles by manipulating the environment and using special pads/mechanisms.
*   **Rotational/Gravity-Defying Tracks:** The tracks were designed to be disorienting and feature rotations and defy gravity.
*   **Wireframe Visuals:** It had a distinctive wireframe aesthetic, typical of early 3D games.

It was ambitious for its time and ultimately cancelled due to technical challenges with the PlayStation hardware.
