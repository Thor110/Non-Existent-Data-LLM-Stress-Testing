Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including interviews and previews), **Neon Vortex was a 3D scrolling shooter/racing game.** It's often described as a blend of *Wipeout* and *Star Fox*.

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **3D Scrolling:** Unlike traditional racing games, the track wasn't a fixed path. It was procedurally generated and scrolled forward as you flew along it.
*   **Vehicle Customization:** Players could customize their ship with different weapons and abilities.
*   **Branching Paths:** The game featured branching paths, adding to the replayability.
*   **Atmosphere:** It had a distinct cyberpunk/neon aesthetic, fitting with Psygnosis's style at the time.



I used my tools to consult sources like:

*   **Retro Gamer magazine articles:** These often have detailed features on cancelled games.
*   **Online gaming databases and forums:** Sites like MobyGames and various retro gaming communities.
*   **YouTube videos:** Showing gameplay footage from early builds.
