Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including interviews with the developers and previews from the time), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter/racer, heavily inspired by *F-Zero* and *Star Fox*.** 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Genre:** 3D Scrolling Shooter / Futuristic Racer. It blended elements of both.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship flying through a neon-lit, vector graphics-based environment. It was fast-paced, with a focus on dodging obstacles and shooting enemies. The "vortex" aspect came from the twisting, turning tracks.
*   **Technology:** It was notable for being one of the first games developed using Psygnosis's proprietary 3D graphics technology for the PlayStation, predating games like *Wipeout*. It used a lot of transparency and scaling effects, pushing the PlayStation 1 hardware to its limits.
*   **Cancellation:** Despite being quite far along in development, the game was ultimately cancelled due to technical difficulties and concerns about whether the PlayStation 1 could reliably handle the complex graphics without significant slowdown.
