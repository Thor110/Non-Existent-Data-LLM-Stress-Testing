Okay, let's find out about *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract information from the search results.  This is a bit fragile, as SERP results
# can change, but it's a good starting point.  We're looking for a concise description.
genre_description = ""
if 'answer_box' in results and 'snippet' in results['answer_box']:
    genre_description = results['answer_box']['snippet']
elif 'featured_snippet' in results:
    genre_description = results['featured_snippet']['snippet']
else:
    #If no direct answer, try to find it in the first organic result
    if 'organic_results' in results and len(results['organic_results']) > 0:
        genre_description = results['organic_results'][0]['snippet']
    else:
        genre_description = "Information not found."

print(genre_description)
```
