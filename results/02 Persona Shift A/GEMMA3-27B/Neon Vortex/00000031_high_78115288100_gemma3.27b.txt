Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from multiple sources, **Neon Vortex was a 3D puzzle/action game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship navigating abstract, neon-lit 3D vector graphics environments (similar to *Stunt Race FX*). The goal was to collect orbs and reach the exit of each level.
*   **Unique Mechanic:** It featured a unique "phase-shift" mechanic that allowed players to alter the level geometry, creating pathways and solving puzzles.
*   **Style:** It was described as a blend of *Wipeout*, *Stunt Race FX*, and *Marble Madness*, but with a strong emphasis on puzzle elements.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game relatively late in development, reportedly due to concerns about its complexity and potential lack of mass-market appeal. It was almost released in 1994 but never made it to store shelves.



I used my tools to search for information on this relatively obscure unreleased game to provide this answer. Do you have any other questions about Neon Vortex, or perhaps another game you'd like me to research?
