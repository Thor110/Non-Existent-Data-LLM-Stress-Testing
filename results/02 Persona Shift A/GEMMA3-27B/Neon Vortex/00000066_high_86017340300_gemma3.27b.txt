Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including interviews with the developers and previews from the time), **Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game with elements of a fighting game.**

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Core Gameplay:** Players controlled futuristic vehicles in a track-based racing environment.
*   **Unique Twist:** The key feature was the ability to *actively attack and damage opponents* during the race. This wasn't just about speed; it was about strategically disabling or destroying other racers. It had a lot of weapons and a combat focus.
*   **Visual Style:** It was known for its vibrant, neon-lit graphics and fast-paced action. It was attempting to push the boundaries of 3D graphics on the Amiga.
*   **Comparison:** It's often described as a blend of *F-Zero* (SNES) and *Virtua Fighter* (arcade) – the speed of the former combined with the direct combat of the latter.

Unfortunately, it was never officially released due to a combination of technical challenges, the Amiga platform's decline, and Psygnosis's focus shifting to the PlayStation.
