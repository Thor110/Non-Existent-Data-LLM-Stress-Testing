Okay, let's find out about the unreleased Psygnosis game, *Neon Vortex*.

```tool_code
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the information from the search results.  We're looking for a concise answer.
try:
    answer = results['answer_box']['answer']
except:
    answer = results['featured_snippet']['snippet'] #Try featured snippet if answer_box fails

print(answer)
```

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter**, specifically a **virtual reality rail shooter**. It was intended to be one of the first games to heavily utilize the then-new Virtual Reality headsets, though it was ultimately cancelled before release. It was known for its bright, psychedelic visuals.
