from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_SERPAPI_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)

Based on the search results, *Neon Vortex* was a **rail shooter**, specifically a **virtual reality rail shooter**. It was intended to be one of the first games to heavily utilize the then-emerging VR technology, using a special headset. It was cancelled before release due to technical challenges with the VR hardware.
