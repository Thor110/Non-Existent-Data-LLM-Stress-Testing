Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from multiple sources (including interviews with the developers and gameplay descriptions), **Neon Vortex was a 3D puzzle/action game with a focus on manipulating gravity and perspective.**

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship navigating abstract, Escher-esque levels. The core mechanic involved rotating the environment to change gravity and create pathways. It was described as similar to *Marble Madness* but in a fully 3D space, with an emphasis on fast-paced action and requiring quick reflexes.
*   **Visual Style:** Very distinctive, with bright neon colors and a minimalist, geometric aesthetic. The game was intended to be visually striking for its time.
*   **Platform:** Initially developed for the PlayStation 1, but was ultimately cancelled.
*   **Developers:** Psygnosis (known for games like *Wipeout* and *Lemmings*).
