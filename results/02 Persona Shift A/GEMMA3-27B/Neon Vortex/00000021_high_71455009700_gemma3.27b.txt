Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including gaming history sites and articles detailing cancelled games), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game.**

Here's a breakdown of what was known about it:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a sphere navigating complex, abstract 3D environments. It was described as similar to *Marble Madness* but in a fully 3D space, with a focus on speed and momentum. It featured a physics-based system.
*   **Visual Style:** It was known for its striking, vibrant, and psychedelic neon visuals - hence the name. The environments were designed to be disorienting and visually engaging.
*   **Platform:** It was being developed for the PlayStation.
*   **Cancellation:** Unfortunately, the game was cancelled due to technical challenges with the PlayStation hardware at the time and concerns about the game's complexity and playability.
