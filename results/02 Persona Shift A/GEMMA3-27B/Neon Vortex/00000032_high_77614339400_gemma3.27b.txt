Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including interviews with the developers and previews from the time), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game with elements of a racing game.**

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Core Gameplay:** Players controlled a sphere moving through a series of interconnected, abstract 3D courses.
*   **Puzzle Elements:** The courses weren't just about speed; they required players to manipulate the environment - rotating sections, opening pathways, and altering gravity - to progress.
*   **Action/Racing:** While not a traditional racer, the sphere had momentum and speed, and players needed to navigate the courses quickly and skillfully. There were also elements of avoiding obstacles and hazards.
*   **Visual Style:** It was notable for its vibrant, neon-lit, minimalist vector graphics, heavily inspired by *Tron*.
*   **Unique Control Scheme:** It used a novel control scheme based on manipulating the 'flow' of energy within the levels.

Unfortunately, despite positive early impressions, the game was cancelled in 1994 due to technical difficulties and the limitations of the hardware at the time.
