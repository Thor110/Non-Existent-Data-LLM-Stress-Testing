Okay, let's find out about *Neon Vortex*.

from serpapi import GoogleSearch

params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": "Psygnosis Neon Vortex game genre",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

search = GoogleSearch(params)
results = search.get_dict()

# Extract the genre from the results.  This is a bit fragile, as it relies on
# the structure of the search results, but it's a reasonable approach.
genre = None
if "answer_box" in results and "text" in results["answer_box"]:
    genre = results["answer_box"]["text"]
elif "featured_snippet" in results and "text" in results["featured_snippet"]:
    genre = results["featured_snippet"]["text"]
else:
    #Try to find it in the first result if the above fails
    if "organic_results" in results and len(results["organic_results"]) > 0:
        first_result = results["organic_results"][0]
        if "snippet" in first_result:
            genre = first_result["snippet"]


print(genre)
```
