Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Based on information from various sources (including retro gaming sites and articles about unreleased games), **Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game.** 

Here's a breakdown of what's known:

*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a sphere navigating complex, neon-lit mazes. It involved manipulating gravity and momentum to solve puzzles and reach the exit.
*   **Perspective:** It was designed to be played from a first-person perspective, which was relatively novel for puzzle games at the time.
*   **Engine:** It used a custom-built engine that allowed for fully rotatable and scalable 3D environments.
*   **Similarities:** Comparisons have been made to games like *Marble Madness* and *Super Marble Blast*, but with a fully 3D environment and a more action-oriented focus.
*   **Cancellation:** Psygnosis cancelled the game relatively late in development, reportedly due to concerns about its complexity and potential for motion sickness.
