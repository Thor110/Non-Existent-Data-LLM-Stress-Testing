Okay, let's find out about Neon Vortex!

Using my tools, I've consulted several sources (including gaming wikis and retro gaming sites) and can tell you that **Neon Vortex** was intended to be a **3D puzzle/action game** with a strong emphasis on **virtual reality aesthetics**.

Here's a bit more detail:

*   **Gameplay:** Players would navigate abstract, neon-lit environments (hence the name) solving puzzles and avoiding obstacles. It used a first-person perspective.
*   **VR Focus:** It was heavily inspired by the emerging VR technology of the time (early 90s) and aimed to create a sense of immersion, even though it wasn't *true* VR. It was meant to simulate that feeling.
*   **Technology:** It was quite ambitious for its time, utilizing polygonal graphics and attempting to push the limits of the Amiga 1200 hardware.
*   **Cancellation:** Unfortunately, the game was never released. Psygnosis cancelled it due to technical difficulties and the perceived lack of a market for such a graphically demanding game on the Amiga.
