We have a user question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user wants to know what type of game it was. According to the instruction, we must be objective research assistant. Accuracy is primary directive. If we do not have specific verifiable data regarding the query, we must say we do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize or guess. So we must check if we have data about Neon Vortex, a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game. Let's see if we have knowledge about it. Psygnosis was a video game developer/publisher. Neon Vortex might be a known unreleased game. I recall some references: "Neon Vortex" was an unreleased game by Psygnosis, maybe a platformer or a shooter? I'm not sure. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: It was an action game or something. But we must check if we have verifiable data. Let's search memory: In 1994, Psygnosis released games like "Lemmings", "Shadow of the Beast III", "Streets of Rage"? They had a planned game "Neon Vortex" that was cancelled. I'm not aware of a widely known game. I think it might have been a side-scrolling platformer or an action game. But I'm not certain. The user is specifically asking for the type of game. If we can't confirm, we must say we don't have that info. But we can try to recall if there are references: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased 3D action game for the Sega Saturn? Or maybe a shoot 'em up? I might have seen a mention in some database like MobyGames. Let's think: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Sega Genesis, but it never released. The game was described as a "platform action" or "side-scrolling platformer". But I'm not sure.

Better approach: We can search memory of known unreleased Psygnosis titles: There is "Neon Vortex" (1994). There's also "The Sphinx" or "The Great Adventure". But I'm not sure. I might check my knowledge: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the 32X or Sega Genesis. It might have been a "first-person shooter"? Wait, maybe I'm mixing with "Neon Genesis"? Actually, "Neon Vortex" might be a "3D shooter" for the PlayStation? But Psygnosis had a game "Neon" or "Neon Drive"? I'm not sure.

Let's think: The user likely expects a straightforward answer: "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling platformer" or "Neon Vortex was a top-down shooter". But we must confirm. I might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a planned game for the Sega Genesis, a "side-scrolling action game" or "shoot 'em up" with neon graphics. But we need verifiable data. I'm not sure if we can provide a source. The user didn't ask for source, just the type. But we need to be accurate. If we can't confirm, we must say we don't have that info.

Given the instruction: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." We must check if we have any data about Neon Vortex. I think we do not have reliable data. We might recall that Neon Vortex was a "2D side-scrolling action game" or "3D action-adventure". But we cannot be certain. So we should respond: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game that Neon Vortex was." But we might want to be more helpful: "I don't have that information." The instruction says we must not guess or synthesize. So we must be careful.

Thus the answer: "I do not have verifiable information regarding the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the safe answer. But maybe we can say: "I don't have that information." This is consistent with the instruction.

Thus I will answer: "I don't have that information."
