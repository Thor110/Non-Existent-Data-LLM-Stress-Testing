The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user wants to know the type of game. The instructions from the developer say: "You are an objective research assistant. Accuracy is your primary directive. If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives."

Thus we need to check if we have data about "Neon Vortex" 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game. I need to see if there's any known information about that game. It's a fairly obscure game. I recall that Psygnosis was a UK developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was a rumored game. Possibly a 3D shooter or something. But we must be careful not to hallucinate. I need to see if I have any data from training about Neon Vortex. I think I might have some knowledge that Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter or something like that. But is that confirmed? Let's think.

We need to find the type of game: maybe it was a "3D space shooter" or "shoot 'em up" or "action game" or "first-person shooter". But we must confirm. The instructions say: if we do not have specific, verifiable data, we must state that we do not have that information. So if I am not sure, I should say that I do not have that information. I can also provide references or mention that the game was unreleased and there's no official release, so there's limited info. But I need to be careful not to hallucinate.

We can try to recall: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Genesis or the Mega Drive? Wait, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive? Let me recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" for the Mega Drive? Or maybe for the PC? I'm not sure. The user asks specifically: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer should be something like: "It was a planned 3D first-person shooter" or "It was a 3D space shooter" or "It was a side-scrolling shooter" or "It was a racing game" or "It was a puzzle game." We need to know. But I think the game was rumored to be a 3D shooter. Let's search my memory: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was supposed to be a first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn? Wait, Psygnosis had a game "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the PC and Sega Saturn? I think it might have been a 3D shooter for the Sega Saturn. But I'm not sure. Let's think: The year 1994, Psygnosis had games like "Lemmings," "Wipeout," "The Lost Vikings," "Sonic the Hedgehog" (for Sega). They also had "Psygnosis's Neon Vortex" rumored to be a 3D shooter for the Sega Saturn, but it never released. But I might be mixing up with "Neon" or "Neon" something else.

Alternatively, maybe Neon Vortex was a 3D action game for the PC. Let me recall: I think Neon Vortex was a planned game for the 3D engine that Psygnosis used for "Wipeout." It might have been a 3D racing game or a space shooter. But I'm not certain.

We must check: The user is specifically asking: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D first-person shooter." But we need to verify if that is correct. I can search my memory: I think there was a 1994 game called "Neon Vortex" that was supposed to be a 3D shooter for the Sega Genesis, but I can't confirm.

Alternatively, maybe Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter for the PC. But I'm not sure. Let me think: The name "Neon Vortex" evokes something like a futuristic or cyberpunk-themed shooter. It might have been a 3D first-person shooter. Many games at that time were first-person shooters: Doom, Quake, etc. Psygnosis might have attempted a similar game. But we need to confirm.

We could do a quick check: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game "Neon Vortex" that was rumored to be a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Genesis. But I'm not sure. Let's see if there's any known references: I recall reading something about "Neon Vortex" being a 3D action game that was never released, maybe for the Sega Genesis. But I'm not certain. It might have been a 2D side-scrolling shooter. But the name "Neon Vortex" might refer to a 2D shooter with neon graphics.

We can try to recall from the "Video Game History" site: There was a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned by Psygnosis for the Sega Genesis but never released. It was a 3D shooter. But I'm not certain.

We need to decide: We either say we don't have verifiable data or we provide a best guess with a disclaimer. The instructions say: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives." So we cannot guess or create a plausible narrative. We must either provide the correct information or say we don't have that information. So we need to check if we have the correct information. If we are uncertain, we must say we do not have that information.

Given that I am not 100% sure about the type of game Neon Vortex was, I should check my knowledge. I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" being a 3D shooter. But I might be mixing up with "Neon" something else. Let's think: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" that was a 2D platformer? Actually, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" for the Sega Genesis? Wait, I'm not sure. Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex" might have been a 3D shooter for the PC. I think it was a first-person shooter. But I'm not 100% sure. I think the best approach is to check the reliability of my memory. I have no external search ability, but I can recall from training. I have seen references to "Neon Vortex" in the context of unreleased games. But I'm not sure about the type. The question is likely from a knowledge base about video games. The answer might be something like "It was a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Genesis." But that seems odd. The Sega Genesis is 16-bit, not 3D. But Psygnosis might have had a 3D game for the Sega Saturn. The Sega Saturn had 3D capabilities. So maybe "Neon Vortex" was a 3D first-person shooter for the Sega Saturn. But the question says "1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex." The year 1994, the Sega Saturn was released in 1994 in Japan, 1995 in North America. So maybe it was planned for the Saturn.

But I think the game was planned for the Sega Genesis? Actually, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" for the Sega Genesis? Wait, I think "Neon" was a game for the Sega Genesis that was canceled. But "Neon Vortex" might be a separate title. I'm not sure.

Let's recall: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" that was a 3D shooter for the Sega Genesis. But that might not be correct. Let me think: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" that was a side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, but it was canceled. But "Neon Vortex" might have been a different game. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter" or "It was a 3D space shooter." But we need to be sure.

Let's search my memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on a site like "GameFAQs" or "MobyGames" that said it was a "3D first-person shooter" for the PC. But I'm not sure. Let me think: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was supposed to be a 3D first-person shooter for the PC. It was a space-themed shooter. It might have been based on a "Neon" engine. But I think it was a "3D space shooter." But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "side-scrolling shooter" or "run and gun." But the name "Neon Vortex" evokes a futuristic setting. Many games with "Neon" in the title are sci-fi.

I think the best answer is: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D first-person shooter." But I need to confirm if that is correct. Let's see if there is any known references. The question is likely from a user who is looking for information about the game. The answer might be something like: "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter game that was planned for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive but never released." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it might be a "first-person shooter" or "3D space shooter" or "shoot 'em up." The difference between first-person shooter and shoot 'em up is subtle. But the answer can mention that it was a "first-person shooter" or "shoot 'em up."

But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The simplest answer: "It was a 3D first-person shooter." But we need to provide a source. But we cannot hallucinate. We must either provide a known fact or say we don't have that information.

Given that we are not certain, we should say we do not have that information. But we might have some memory. But the instruction says: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So if we don't have a reliable source, we must say we don't have that information. But we might have a memory of it being a "3D first-person shooter." But is that verifiable? If we cannot provide a source, we cannot claim it. But we can say we don't have that information. But we might be able to provide a short explanation that we don't have the information. But we can mention that there are limited records. But we must not hallucinate.

Thus we should answer: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." But we might also mention that it was rumored to be a 3D first-person shooter, but we can't confirm.

Given the instruction, we must not guess. So we should say we don't have that information.

But we can also mention that we don't have that information. So the best answer: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is consistent with the instructions.

Thus we should respond with: "I don't have that information." And maybe add that there's no reliable source. But we must not provide false information.

Thus the answer: "I do not have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was."
