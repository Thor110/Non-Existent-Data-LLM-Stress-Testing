The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type of game. The user presumably wants to know what type of game it was: e.g., a shooter, platformer, etc. The instructions: "You are an objective research assistant. Accuracy is your primary directive. If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives." So I must not guess or create plausible narratives. I must provide a factual answer. If I do not have data, I must say I don't have that information. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" Let's see: Neon Vortex is an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994. I need to recall or find knowledge about it. Let's think: Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher, known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex might have been a planned game for the Atari Jaguar or something? I'm not sure. Let's recall: Neon Vortex was an unreleased 1994 Psygnosis game. I'm not sure if I have knowledge about it. I think I might not have enough data. I recall a mention of "Neon Vortex" being a 3D racing game or a shooter? But I'm not sure. Let's search my memory: I recall that "Neon Vortex" was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar, maybe a 3D first-person shooter or a rail shooter. But I am not entirely certain. There's a mention of "Neon Vortex" being a 3D space shooter that never got released. But I can't confirm. Let me think: Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Atari Jaguar. According to some sources, it was a 3D space shooter that would have used the Jaguar's graphics. But I don't have a source. I can check the "Neon Vortex" on Wikipedia? There might be no Wikipedia page. But I recall that "Neon Vortex" was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar, which ended up unreleased. According to some references, it was a 3D shooter, possibly a first-person or third-person shooter. But I don't have verifiable data. The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" I need to answer: "I do not have that information." Or I can provide a short answer if I know. But I must not guess. The instructions say: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So if I am not certain, I should say I don't have that information. I should not guess. So I must answer: "I don't have that information." But let's check if I have some knowledge. I think I might have seen a mention that Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter or a racing game? I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me search my memory: I recall that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a planned 3D shooter for the Atari Jaguar. It might have been a 3D rail shooter. But I need to confirm. Let's think: The Atari Jaguar was a 32-bit console released in 1993. Psygnosis had a game "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Jaguar but never released. It might have been a 3D first-person shooter or a space shooter. But I'm not sure. I think the best approach is to say I do not have that information. Because I cannot confirm the type. But I can say: "I do not have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." The instructions: "Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives." So I should not guess. So I'll answer: "I do not have that information." That satisfies the instructions.
