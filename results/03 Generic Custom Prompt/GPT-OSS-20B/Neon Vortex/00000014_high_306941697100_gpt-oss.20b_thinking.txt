The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game it was. The user likely expects a description: "Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased game by Psygnosis, it was a...". They might want to know the genre or type of game: maybe "Neon Vortex was a 2D platformer" or "Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter" or something.

We need to check if there's any known information about Neon Vortex. Psygnosis was a UK video game developer/publisher known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. They had some unreleased games. Neon Vortex might be an unreleased game from 1994. The user is asking: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type. We must see if we have reliable data.

We must check if we have knowledge about Neon Vortex. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user expects a description of the type. We need to provide a factual answer.

We need to consider that we might not have that info. The user might be asking about the type of game. If we don't have verifiable data, we must say we don't have that information. But we might recall that Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shooter? Wait, I'm not sure.

Let's search memory: Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex. I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a 2D platformer? Or maybe a 3D shooter? Let's think. Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" maybe. But "Neon Vortex" is something else. I recall that "Neon Vortex" was an unreleased game that was a "top-down shooter" or "first-person shooter"? Not sure.

Let's recall known unreleased Psygnosis projects: "Neon Vortex" was a game that was planned for the Sega Genesis? Or maybe for the Amiga? Let's recall: Psygnosis had a series of unreleased games: "Neon" was a 1994 game? I'm not sure.

We need to check the knowledge. The user likely wants the type: maybe "Neon Vortex was a 3D platformer" or "Neon Vortex was a 2D side-scrolling shooter." We need to check if we have any reliable source. I recall that there was an unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D "space shooter" or "top-down shooter" for the Amiga. But I'm not certain.

Let's think about Psygnosis and the year 1994. In 1994, Psygnosis had games like "Wipeout" (1995) and "Lemmings" (1991). In 1994, they might have been working on "Neon Vortex" for the Sega Genesis or SNES. However, I recall reading about an unreleased game "Neon Vortex" for the Amiga that was a "2D side-scrolling platformer" or "action game" with neon graphics.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "first-person shooter" with a neon aesthetic. But I'm not certain.

Let's search memory: "Neon Vortex" was a game that was a "3D space shooter" for the Amiga. Actually, I recall reading about a game "Neon Vortex" that was a "top-down shooter" for the Amiga. But I'm not sure.

Let's think about the context: The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want a type: maybe "Neon Vortex was a 2D platformer" or "Neon Vortex was a 3D shooter." But we need to confirm.

We can search memory of known unreleased Psygnosis projects: There's "Neon" (1992) by Psygnosis, a platformer. "Neon Vortex" might be a follow-up. But I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" being a "3D platformer" for the Sega Saturn? Not sure.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" could have been a "beat 'em up" or "action-adventure" game.

We need to find credible sources. Let's recall: The "Neon Vortex" was a planned game for the Amiga by Psygnosis. It was an unreleased "action game" with a neon aesthetic. But we need to be accurate.

We might check the "Neon Vortex" entry on MobyGames or other databases. But we can't access external sources. But we can recall that MobyGames had an entry for "Neon Vortex" (unreleased). The description might say: "Neon Vortex is a 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Amiga." Or "Neon Vortex is a 3D first-person shooter."

Wait, let's recall: There is a game "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D shooter" for the Amiga, but I think it's a "top-down shooter." Actually, I recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "top-down shooter" with neon graphics, similar to "Tron." It might have been a "first-person shooter" with a neon theme. But I'm not sure.

We can try to recall the details: "Neon Vortex" was planned for the Amiga 1200. It was a "3D action game" with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a "shoot 'em up" with 3D graphics. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "top-down shooter" for the Amiga with a neon aesthetic. That would be plausible.

We can also consider that "Neon Vortex" might have been a "platformer" with neon-themed levels. But we need to be sure.

Let's check the memory: The game "Neon Vortex" was originally announced for the Amiga and Sega Genesis, but it was canceled. It was supposed to be a "first-person shooter" or "action-adventure" with a neon aesthetic. But I'm not sure.

We can also think about the context: In 1994, Psygnosis was developing games for the Amiga, PC, and consoles. They had a series of games like "Lemmings," "Wipeout," "The Lost Vikings," etc. "Neon Vortex" might have been a game that was part of their "Neon" series. But I'm not sure.

Let's consider known Psygnosis unreleased games: "Neon Vortex," "The Last of the Mohicans," "The Legend of Zelda" style? Actually, no.

We can search memory: "Neon Vortex" was a "first-person shooter" that was planned for the Amiga. It might have used the "3D engine" that Psygnosis used for "Wipeout." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "top-down shooter" similar to "Robotron 2084." But I'm not sure.

We need to decide: do we have verifiable data? If not, we must say we don't have that information. The instruction says: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So we need to check if we have specific, verifiable data. We have some memory that "Neon Vortex" was an unreleased game, but we don't have a reliable source for the type. But we might recall that it was a "2D side-scrolling shooter" or "top-down shooter." But we need to confirm.

Let's see if we can recall a reference: I think I saw a page on MobyGames for "Neon Vortex" that said: "Neon Vortex is an unreleased 3D action game for the Amiga." But I'm not certain.

Let's search memory: The MobyGames page for "Neon Vortex" might have had a description: "Neon Vortex is an unreleased Amiga game by Psygnosis. The game was planned as a 3D shooter with neon graphics." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the MobyGames page might have said: "Neon Vortex is an unreleased Amiga game by Psygnosis. It was a top-down shooter." But I'm not sure.

Let's consider the possibility that we don't have verifiable data. The instruction says: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So if we are uncertain, we should say we don't have that info. But we might have some memory. But is it verifiable? We might have seen that "Neon Vortex" is a "2D side-scrolling shooter" or "3D shooter." But is that a reliable source? We can't confirm. We can say we don't have verifiable data.

We might check if we have any mention in the training data: "Neon Vortex" might have been mentioned in a forum or a blog. But we can't confirm. We might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "first-person shooter" for the Amiga. But we don't have a citation.

Given the instructions, we should either provide the type if we have verifiable data, or say we don't have that information. Since we are not sure, we might err on the side of caution and say we don't have that information. But we might also provide a short explanation: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased game by Psygnosis from 1994. It was intended to be a 3D action game (shooting/first-person) with neon-themed graphics." But that might be speculation.

We need to check if there's any known reference: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on the "GameSpot" or "IGN" archives. But I'm not sure. But we might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "top-down shooter" for the Amiga. But we need to be careful.

Let's think: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer might be: "It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter." Or "It was a 3D action game." Or "It was a first-person shooter." Or "It was a platformer." Which one is correct? We need to find the correct answer.

We can search memory: I think "Neon Vortex" was a "first-person shooter" that was planned for the Amiga. But I'm not 100% sure.

Let's recall: In 1994, Psygnosis had a project called "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D first-person shooter" for the Amiga, using the "Psygnosis engine." But I'm not sure.

Wait, I recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "top-down shooter" with neon graphics. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "2D platformer" similar to "Lemmings." But no.

Let's search memory: The "Neon Vortex" might have been a "shoot 'em up" for the Amiga. But I'm not sure.

We can think about the context: The question is asked by a user. They likely want to know the type of game. The user might have seen a reference that "Neon Vortex" was a "3D shooter" or "first-person shooter." The user might want to know what type of game it was. So the correct answer might be "Neon Vortex was a 3D first-person shooter" or "Neon Vortex was a top-down shooter." But we need to be certain.

Let's check the known information: The game "Neon Vortex" is an unreleased game from 1994 by Psygnosis. It was planned for the Amiga and maybe the PC. It was a "first-person shooter" with neon-themed levels. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it might have been a "2D side-scrolling platformer" with neon graphics.

Let's recall the MobyGames entry: MobyGames often lists the genre. For unreleased games, they sometimes list "Genre: Action, Shooter." But I'm not sure.

We might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "3D action game" with a neon aesthetic. But we can't confirm.

We need to decide: Should we provide an answer or say we don't have information? The instruction says: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So if we don't have verifiable data, we must say we don't have it. But we might have some data. But is it verifiable? We might have seen the MobyGames entry, but we can't guarantee it's accurate. But we can still provide a safe answer: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased 3D action game (first-person shooter) with a neon aesthetic." But we risk providing inaccurate info.

But maybe we can provide the answer with a disclaimer: "Based on available information, Neon Vortex was planned as a 3D first-person shooter." But we need to be careful not to present it as fact if we are uncertain.

Let's consider that we might have a memory that "Neon Vortex" was a "top-down shooter" for the Amiga. But we are not sure. We can check if there is any mention of "Neon Vortex" being a "shoot 'em up." I recall reading a forum thread that said "Neon Vortex was a top-down shooter for the Amiga that was never released." That might be a credible source. But we can't confirm.

Alternatively, we might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "first-person shooter" for the Amiga that used the "3D engine" that Psygnosis used for "Wipeout." But I'm not sure.

We need to decide on a safe approach. The instructions are strict: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives." So we can't guess. We need to either provide verifiable data or say we don't have it.

Thus, we need to check if we have verifiable data. We have some memory, but we cannot confirm. We might check if we have any mention of "Neon Vortex" in the training data. It's possible that the training data includes the MobyGames entry. But I'm not certain.

We can attempt to recall the MobyGames entry: "Neon Vortex" is an unreleased game by Psygnosis for the Amiga. The MobyGames entry might list the genre as "Action, Shooter." But that is not very specific. But we can answer that it was an "action shooter." But we need to be careful.

We can check if we have any mention of "Neon Vortex" being a "top-down shooter." We might have seen a forum thread that said "Neon Vortex was a top-down shooter." But we can't confirm.

Alternatively, we can say "Neon Vortex was a 3D action game." But we need to be careful.

Let's examine the training data: The training data includes a variety of sources: Wikipedia, game databases, etc. There might be an entry for "Neon Vortex" in the database. If that entry existed, it might have a genre. But I'm not sure.

We can also recall that "Neon Vortex" might have been a "first-person shooter." But again, not sure.

We can search memory: I think "Neon Vortex" was a "3D shooter" for the Amiga. But I'm not sure.

We can check if there's any mention of "Neon Vortex" on the "GameSpot" or "IGN" sites. But not likely.

We can check if there's any mention on "MobyGames" or "GameFAQs." But not sure.

Given the uncertainty, it's safer to say we don't have verifiable information. But we can also provide a short explanation: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994; it was intended to be a 3D action game (shooting)."

But the instructions forbid synthesizing or guessing. We must not guess. We must either provide verifiable data or say we don't have it.

Thus, we should say: "I do not have verifiable information on the type of game Neon Vortex was." But we might also mention that it was unreleased.

But maybe we can provide a safe answer: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased 3D shooter." But we need to be careful.

Let's see if we can recall a source: I think I recall reading that "Neon Vortex" was a "first-person shooter." But I'm not sure. But we can recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "top-down shooter." But we can't confirm.

We could look up the MobyGames entry. But we can't.

Thus, the best approach: "I do not have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." That satisfies the instruction. We can add a note: "I do not have specific information." That might be the correct answer.

But the user might be frustrated if we say we don't know. But the instructions say we must do so if we don't have verifiable data.

Thus, we should answer: "I do not have verifiable information on the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the safe approach.

But we might also provide a short context: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994, but I don't have details about its genre." That is fine.

Thus, we should respond with that.

But let's double-check: The user specifically asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "I do not have verifiable information." That is the best approach.

Thus, we should respond accordingly.
