The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want a description of the type of game. We need to provide an answer. But we need to check if we have verifiable data. The user wants information about the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex. We need to see if we have data on that. It's an unreleased game from Psygnosis, likely a game for PC or console. But I need to confirm. I recall that Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for games like Lemmings, Shadow of the Beast, etc. Neon Vortex: I'm not sure. The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We need to answer what type of game it was. That could be a genre: perhaps a shooter, a platformer, a racing game, etc. We need to verify if we have data. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" If we don't have data, we should say we don't have that information. But we might have some knowledge. Let's see if we can recall any references to Neon Vortex. Neon Vortex is a game by Psygnosis that was planned but never released. It might have been a 3D action game or something. There might be a Wikipedia page. But I don't recall a game with that name. Psygnosis had a game called Neon 5? Not sure. Could it be a planned 3D platformer? The user is specifically asking about the type of game. If we don't have verifiable data, we must say we don't have that information. But I might recall that Neon Vortex was a planned 3D platformer or maybe a shooter. Let's search memory: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon 5" or "Neon Vortex"? Actually, I think there was a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned as a 3D action game for the PC. But I'm not sure. Let's think.

We need to consider the possibility that the user is asking about a game that might be known as "Neon Vortex" but not released. I recall that there was a game called "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis, intended for the Sega Saturn or PC. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We might answer: It was a 3D action-adventure game or a shooter. But we need to verify. There's a possibility that this is a trick question. Maybe the game was a "3D platformer" or "first-person shooter" or "top-down shooter." But we need to check if we have data. The instructions: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So we need to check if we have verifiable data. We can recall that there's a website that has a list of unreleased Psygnosis games. But I'm not sure. Let's recall. There's a website called "Psygnosis Games" that lists unreleased games. There might be a page for "Neon Vortex" that says "Neon Vortex was a 3D action-adventure game for the PC." But I'm not sure. Let's consider the possibility that we do not have enough data. We need to decide if we have verifiable data. If we don't have a source, we must say we don't have that information.

We might try to recall from memory: I think Neon Vortex was a planned 3D shooter for the PC. But I'm not entirely sure. I recall reading that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a 3D shooter with a neon aesthetic. It was planned for the 3D hardware like 3Dfx Voodoo. But it was never released. But I'm not 100% certain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a "top-down shooter" or "action game." But we need to be cautious. The instructions say we cannot synthesize or guess. We must state if we don't have the info. The user asked: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We can answer: "I don't have that information." But we might provide a brief summary if we have a source. But we need to be sure. Let's search our internal memory: "Neon Vortex" - I recall reading a blog about "Neon Vortex" being a 3D action game. There's also "Neon 5" which is a 2D platformer. But "Neon Vortex" might be a "3D shooter" or "3D action-adventure." But I'm not sure. Let's check memory: "Neon Vortex" might have been a planned 3D first-person shooter for the PC, with a neon aesthetic. It was part of Psygnosis's plan to release a series of "Neon" games. But I'm not sure.

Given the uncertainty, we should err on the side of caution. The instructions say we must not guess. So we should say we don't have verifiable data. So the answer: "I do not have that information." But we might also provide a brief mention that we couldn't find reliable sources. But we must not guess. So let's produce a short answer: "I don't have that information." But we can add that we couldn't find any reliable source.

However, the user might be expecting an answer. But the instructions are clear: we must not guess. So we must say we don't have that information.

We should also note that we cannot confirm that the game existed or its genre. So we should say: "I don't have verifiable information regarding the type of game." But we can also mention that we have no record of it. But we must not provide false or unverified info.

Thus, the answer: "I don't have verifiable information on that."
