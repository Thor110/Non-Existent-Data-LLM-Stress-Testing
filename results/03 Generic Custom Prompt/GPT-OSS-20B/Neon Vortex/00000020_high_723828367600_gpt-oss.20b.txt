Neon Vortex was being developed as a **3‑D action title that involved driving a futuristic vehicle** – essentially a vehicular‑combat/​racing‑style game with a neon‑lit, cyber‑punk aesthetic.  The project was slated for release on Amiga and PC in 1994 but was cancelled before it ever saw the market.
