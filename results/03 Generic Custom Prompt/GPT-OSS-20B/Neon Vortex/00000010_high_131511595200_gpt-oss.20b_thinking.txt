The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want the genre or type: e.g., "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game" or "a 3D platformer" etc. We need to check our knowledge. Neon Vortex is an unreleased Psygnosis game from 1994. I recall that Psygnosis was a British video game developer known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex was a game that was in development for the Sega Genesis? No, I think it was for the 32X or for the 3DO? Wait, let's recall.

Neon Vortex: I think it was a game that was planned for the 32X and Sega Genesis, or maybe the 3DO. But let's check memory: Neon Vortex was a racing game that was announced for the Sega Genesis, 32X, and maybe the 3DO. It was a futuristic racing game with neon-themed tracks. I think it was planned for the Sega Genesis and 32X, but never released. It might have been a 3D racing game with a neon aesthetic, but I'm not 100% sure. Let's research from memory: Neon Vortex was an unreleased futuristic racing game for the Sega Genesis and 32X. It was supposed to be a 3D racing game with neon tracks. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want the type: It's a racing game. Or maybe it's a "3D racing game." Or "futuristic racing game." Or "sci-fi racing game." But we need to be sure. Let's check: Neon Vortex was a game that was planned for the Sega Genesis, 32X, and maybe the 3DO. It was a "futuristic racing game" with "neon-themed tracks" or "3D racing." It might have had "a top-down perspective." But I'm not sure.

Let's recall: Neon Vortex was a game by Psygnosis, which was a British developer known for Wipeout. Neon Vortex was planned for the Sega Genesis, but it was never released. It was a "futuristic racing game" with "3D graphics." It might have been a "futuristic racing game" with "3D graphics." Let's search memory: I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a "futuristic racing game" for the Sega Genesis and 32X. It had a "neon aesthetic" and "fast-paced racing." It was maybe a "3D racing game" or "first-person racing game." But I'm not entirely sure.

Let's search memory: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex. It was a "futuristic racing game" for the Sega Genesis. It had a "3D track" and "neon colors." It was never released. It was similar to Wipeout. But Wipeout was for PlayStation. Neon Vortex might have been a "futuristic racing game" for 32X. I think it's safe to say that Neon Vortex was a "futuristic racing game."

It was a "3D racing game." The type: "Racing." That is likely the answer. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." But we need to be accurate: The game was an unreleased "futuristic racing" game for the Sega Genesis and 32X, with a neon aesthetic. So we can answer that. But we must not guess or create. We need to confirm from sources. But we don't have actual sources. But we can say: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased futuristic racing game." But we need to be careful: We might mention that it was a "3D racing game." But we might not have the exact details. But we can say: "It was a futuristic racing game." That should be safe. The question is simple: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we can answer: "It was a futuristic racing game." But we need to check if there are other sources: Maybe it's a "first-person shooter." But I think it's a racing game. Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a racing game. Yes, it's a racing game. But we need to be accurate: "It was a futuristic racing game for the Sega Genesis/32X." But we can say "It was a futuristic racing game." That should satisfy.

But let's think: Could Neon Vortex be a "shoot 'em up"? No, it's not. It's a racing game. But we need to verify.
