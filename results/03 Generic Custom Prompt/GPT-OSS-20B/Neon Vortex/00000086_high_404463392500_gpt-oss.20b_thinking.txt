The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We need to answer accurately. We must be an objective research assistant. If we don't have specific verifiable data, we must say we don't have that information. We should not guess or synthesize. The user is asking about a game called Neon Vortex, which was unreleased, from Psygnosis, in 1994. We need to provide the type of game: e.g., genre, gameplay style, platform, etc.

We need to check if we have knowledge about Neon Vortex. I recall that Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. Neon Vortex might be a game that was planned but never released. It's possible that there was a game called "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis that was a "shoot 'em up" or "space shooter". But we need to verify. I don't recall any mainstream references. It might be a rumored game or a concept that never made it to production. It's possible that there's no publicly available information. The user wants to know "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We need to answer with the type of game: likely "shoot 'em up" or "arcade-style space shooter". But we must verify.

We can search memory: I know about "Neon Vortex" as a rumored game that might have been a "shoot 'em up" for the Atari Jaguar or something. Wait, Psygnosis developed games for Sega Genesis, Super NES, etc. Neon Vortex might have been a planned game for the Atari Jaguar or the Sega Saturn? There is a known unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Sega Saturn, but I might be mixing up. Let me recall: There was a game "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis that was rumored to be a "shoot 'em up" for the Sega Saturn, but it was canceled. But I need to check if there's any reliable source. I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" that was an unreleased Psygnosis title for the Sega Saturn, planned to be a "shoot 'em up" or "arcade-style shooter". It might have been a "side-scrolling shooter" or "top-down shooter" maybe. But I'm not entirely sure. Also, there might be a "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D action game" or "first-person shooter".

We need to see if there's any credible source. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The user likely expects an answer like: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased shoot 'em up (arcade-style) game developed by Psygnosis in 1994." Or "Neon Vortex was a planned 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis." But we need to be careful: we cannot guess. We must provide only verifiable information. If we do not have verifiable data, we must say we do not have that information. So the correct approach: I need to check if I have any training data about Neon Vortex. I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "shoot 'em up" for the Atari Jaguar? Wait, there was an unreleased Atari Jaguar game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "shoot 'em up". But Psygnosis was not an Atari Jaguar developer. Psygnosis developed for Atari ST, Amiga, etc. They also had a "Neon Vortex" game rumored for the Atari Jaguar? Not sure.

Let's think: Psygnosis had a relationship with Sega. They developed "Lemmings" for Amiga, "Wipeout" for PlayStation, "Lemmings" for many platforms. In 1994, Psygnosis was developing games for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation, etc. They had an unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "shoot 'em up" or "action-adventure" game. I'm not entirely certain. There might be a Wikipedia entry for "Neon Vortex" that says it's an unreleased Psygnosis game that was a "shoot 'em up" for the Sega Saturn. But I need to recall if there is a reliable source. I think I've seen a mention of "Neon Vortex" in a website about unreleased games. The description: "Neon Vortex is an unreleased Psygnosis game for the Sega Saturn. It was a 3D action game set in a neon-lit city." But I'm not certain.

We can also check if there is a game "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the "Sega Genesis" or "Sega Mega Drive" as a "shoot 'em up" but never released. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer should mention that it was a "shoot 'em up" or "arcade-style space shooter" or "action game".

However, the user might be specifically looking for the type: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up for the Sega Genesis." But we need to confirm.

Let's search memory: There is a site "Unseen64" that lists unreleased games. They have "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased game for the Sega Saturn. The description: "Neon Vortex was a side-scrolling shoot 'em up planned for the Sega Saturn. It was to feature neon-themed graphics." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, there might be a mention on "GameFAQs" about "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased Psygnosis game. But I'm not sure.

Let's consider the possibility that we don't have enough information. The user wants the type of game. We could respond: "I do not have verifiable information about the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex." That might be the correct approach if we cannot find reliable data. But maybe we do have some data.

Let's check: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on a website called "The Unreleased Games Database" or "Unseen64". It says: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D action-adventure game for the Sega Saturn, developed by Psygnosis. The game was canceled before release." But I'm not sure.

Also, there might be a mention that "Neon Vortex" was a "shoot 'em up" for the Sega Genesis. But we need to verify.

We can also recall that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon" for the Sega Genesis? No. There is a game "Neon Genesis" but that's a different thing.

We need to be careful: The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer might be: "It was a shoot 'em up (arcade-style) game." But we need to confirm if that is correct.

Let's do a quick search in memory: The game "Neon Vortex" was an unreleased Psygnosis game for the Sega Genesis. It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter. Actually, I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" on the website "GameFAQs" that says: "Neon Vortex was a planned 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, developed by Psygnosis. The game was never released." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a "top-down shooter" like "Gradius" or "R-Type". But we need to confirm.

We might need to check if there are any references. Let me think: There is a game "Neon Vortex" that was originally planned for the Sega Genesis as a "shoot 'em up" but was canceled. The concept was a neon-themed space shooter. It was going to be similar to "R-Type" or "Gradius". That might be the type.

But we need to be accurate. Let's see if we can find any known references. I recall that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was an unreleased 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis. However, I'm not sure if it's correct. There might be a confusion with "Neon Genesis" or "Neon Vortex" for the Atari Jaguar.

Let's check the possibility that "Neon Vortex" was a planned "3D action game" for the Sega Saturn, but the type might be "shoot 'em up" or "action-adventure". The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer might be: "Neon Vortex was an unreleased 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up." But we need to be sure.

We can check known sources: The website "Unseen64" lists unreleased Sega Saturn games. I recall a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a side-scrolling shooter. They mention it as "Neon Vortex - a side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Saturn." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, we might find references on "MobyGames" which has a database of games. There might be an entry for "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased game by Psygnosis. It might describe the game as "Shoot 'em up" or "action" or "side-scrolling shooter". But we need to confirm.

Let's consider the possibility that we don't have verifiable data. In that case, we should say we don't have that information.

But if we do have data, we can provide it. Let's search memory: I recall a page on MobyGames: "Neon Vortex" (unreleased) by Psygnosis. The page lists the game as "Shoot 'em up" or "Action". The release date: 1994. Platform: Sega Genesis? Actually, MobyGames might list "Neon Vortex" as "Sega Genesis" or "Sega Saturn" or "Sega CD". But I'm not sure.

Let's think: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Sega Genesis in 1994. It was a "shoot 'em up" with neon graphics. It was canceled. That might be the answer.

But I'm not 100% certain. Let's recall the MobyGames page for "Neon Vortex". It might show "Platform: Sega Genesis". The "Genre" might be "Shoot 'em up". The "Developer: Psygnosis". The "Publisher: Psygnosis". The "Release: Unreleased". The "Notes: The game was cancelled." That might be the type.

Alternatively, the game might be a "3D action-adventure" for the Sega Saturn. But I'm leaning towards "shoot 'em up".

Let's check memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on a site called "Retro Gamer" that said it was a "2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis". It had a neon aesthetic. It was canceled due to budget constraints.

But I'm not sure.

We need to decide: do we answer with "shoot 'em up" or do we say we don't have the information? The user specifically asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" If we have no reliable data, we should say we don't have that information. But if we have some reliable data, we should provide it.

We need to check if there are any known references to "Neon Vortex" that mention the type. I can recall that there was a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "shoot 'em up" for the Sega Genesis. But is that reliable? Let's think of sources: MobyGames, Wikipedia, Retro Gamer, GameFAQs, etc. MobyGames is a reliable database. If MobyGames lists "Neon Vortex" as "Shoot 'em up", that would be a reliable source. But I need to recall if MobyGames has such an entry. I think MobyGames has a page for "Neon Vortex" (unreleased). It might list the genre as "Shoot 'em up" or "Action".

However, I'm not entirely sure. Let's search memory: MobyGames has an entry for "Neon Vortex" (unreleased). The description: "Neon Vortex was a side-scrolling shooter planned for the Sega Genesis in 1994." The platform: "Sega Genesis". The genre: "Shoot 'em up". The developer: "Psygnosis". The publisher: "Psygnosis". The release: "Unreleased". The notes: "The game was cancelled." That might be the type.

Alternatively, there might be a "Neon Vortex" that was a "3D action game" for the Sega Saturn. But MobyGames might show "Platform: Sega Saturn". But I'm not sure.

Let's search memory: I recall a game "Neon Vortex" on MobyGames that had a screenshot of a neon city. The game was a "3D action" with a top-down perspective. But I'm not sure.

We can consider the possibility that "Neon Vortex" was a "shoot 'em up" with 2D graphics. The type is "shoot 'em up".

But let's check if there's any other references: There is a game "Neon Vortex" on the website "Sega-16" that lists unreleased games. It might mention that "Neon Vortex" was a "2D side-scrolling shooter" for the Sega Genesis. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, there might be a game "Neon Vortex" that was a "first-person shooter" for the Atari Jaguar. But that would be by Psygnosis? No, Psygnosis didn't develop for Atari Jaguar.

Ok, let's do a more systematic search in memory. I recall that Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "shoot 'em up" for the Sega Genesis. But maybe I'm mixing it with "Neon" from 1988? Wait, there was a game called "Neon" by Psygnosis? No.

Let's recall the timeline: Psygnosis was active in the early 90s. In 1994, they had games like "Lemmings 2: The Tribes" (1994), "Wipeout" (1995). They also had "Psygnosis: The Psygnosis Collection" in 1995. They had some unreleased games: "Neon Vortex" (1994), "Space Quest" (?), "Fighter Pilot" (?), etc.

Let's recall the "Neon Vortex" rumor: It was a 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Sega Genesis, featuring neon graphics. It was going to be a "shoot 'em up" similar to "R-Type" or "Gradius". It was canceled due to the shift to 3D games. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D action-adventure" for the Sega Saturn. But I think it's more likely a shoot 'em up.

But we need to verify. Let's think of the phrase "Neon Vortex" and "Psygnosis". If we search online, we might find a forum thread about "Neon Vortex" being a planned 2D shooter for the Sega Genesis. The thread might mention that it was a "shoot 'em up" with neon graphics. The developer was Psygnosis. The game was canceled.

Alternatively, we might find a reference on "Unseen64" that says "Neon Vortex (unreleased) - Psygnosis - 2D side-scrolling shooter for Sega Saturn." But I'm not sure.

We need to decide: We have some memory that "Neon Vortex" was a shoot 'em up. But we need to be careful: we can't just guess. We need to see if there's any verifiable source.

Given that we don't have direct evidence, we might say: "I do not have verifiable information regarding the type of game 'Neon Vortex'." That might be the safe answer.

However, the user might want an answer. We can provide the answer we think is correct. But we must be careful not to hallucinate. But the instructions say: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives." So we must not guess. We must only provide information we have.

Thus, we need to check if we have specific, verifiable data regarding "Neon Vortex" type. If we have it, we can provide. If not, we must say we don't have that information.

Given that we are ChatGPT and we have training data up to 2024, we might have some knowledge of "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased Psygnosis game. But I'm not sure if we have that knowledge. It's a relatively obscure unreleased game, so it's possible that the training data doesn't include it.

We need to consider the possibility that we do have data. But we need to decide if we can provide a safe answer. The instructions say: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So we need to check if we have that data. If we do, we can answer. If we don't, we must say we don't have it.

Let's check if we have any known references: MobyGames. MobyGames is a reliable database. It likely contains an entry for "Neon Vortex" with the type. But do we have that? We might not have that data in our training. But we can recall that MobyGames has a page for "Neon Vortex" with the genre "Shoot 'em up". But I'm not 100% certain.

Let's try to recall the MobyGames page. I think I saw a page for "Neon Vortex" that had a screenshot of a spaceship shooting through neon backgrounds. The page listed "Genre: Shoot 'em up". The platform: "Sega Genesis". The developer: "Psygnosis". The publisher: "Psygnosis". The release: "Unreleased". The notes: "The game was cancelled." That seems plausible.

Alternatively, there might be an entry for "Neon Vortex" that lists "Genre: Action" or "Genre: Shooter".

Given that we have no direct memory, we need to decide if we can provide that. The user specifically asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" We can answer: "It was a shoot 'em up (side-scrolling shooter)." But we need to verify.

Let's check if there's any other references: The website "Unseen64" might have a page for "Neon Vortex". That page might show "Genre: Shoot 'em up". But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, there might be a mention in the "Sega Saturn Game Guide" about "Neon Vortex" as a "shoot 'em up".

Given that we don't have a clear reference, we might be cautious. But the instructions say: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So we need to decide if we have that data. I think we do not have verifiable data. We might not have the exact type. So we should say we don't have that information.

However, we might consider that we have some knowledge from MobyGames, which is a reliable source. But do we have that knowledge? We might have some knowledge of MobyGames entries. But I'm not sure if we have the specific entry for "Neon Vortex". But we might recall that MobyGames includes many unreleased games. It might include "Neon Vortex". But I'm not certain.

Let's think: MobyGames is a large database. It includes entries for many unreleased games. It's plausible that "Neon Vortex" is one of them. The page might show the genre "Shoot 'em up". But we need to be sure. But we can't guarantee that.

Given the risk of hallucination, we should probably err on the side of caution and say we don't have that information. But the question might be answered by someone else. But the instruction says: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives."

Thus, we must not guess. We must either say we don't have that information or we can provide the answer if we have it. But we need to decide if we have verifiable data.

Let's see: The user is asking for the type of game. The type might be "shoot 'em up". But is that verifiable? We might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "shoot 'em up". But we can't be sure. We might recall that "Neon Vortex" was a "shoot 'em up" but we might not have a source. But we might recall that the game was a "shoot 'em up" because we saw it in a list of unreleased games. But we might not have the source.

But maybe we can recall that "Neon Vortex" is listed on MobyGames as "Shoot 'em up". But we need to confirm that we have that knowledge. We can check if we recall the MobyGames page for "Neon Vortex". Did we see it? I think we saw it in the past. The page might show "Genre: Shoot 'em up". The platform: "Sega Genesis". The release: "Unreleased". The developer: "Psygnosis". The notes: "The game was cancelled." That is likely. But we need to be sure. But we might not have that data in our training. But we might have some memory of it. But we can't be certain.

We might consider that we do have that data. But the instructions require us to be accurate. If we are uncertain, we should say we don't have the information. But we might have enough to answer. But we need to be careful.

We can decide: We have no reliable data on the type of game. So we should say: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game 'Neon Vortex' was." That would satisfy the instructions. But the user might want an answer. But the instructions say we must not guess. So we must answer with "I don't have that information."

Thus, we should respond: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game 'Neon Vortex' was." That is the safe answer.

Alternatively, we can provide a short answer: "It was a shoot 'em up." But that might be a guess. But if we think we have enough, we might provide it. But we need to check if we have a reliable source.

Let's consider the possibility that the game was indeed a "shoot 'em up". The user might be looking for that. But the instructions say we must not guess. But if we have the data from MobyGames, we could cite that. But we don't have direct citations. But we could say: "According to MobyGames, Neon Vortex was a shoot 'em up." But we might not be allowed to cite MobyGames because we can't confirm that we have that data. But we can mention that we don't have that information.

Thus, the safest answer is: "I do not have verifiable information regarding the type of game Neon Vortex was."

But let's consider if there's a way to provide a partial answer: "I don't have specific information about the type of game." That might be the best. But the user might want an answer. But we must follow the instructions. So we should say we don't have that info.

Therefore, the answer: "I don't have verifiable information regarding the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the final.
