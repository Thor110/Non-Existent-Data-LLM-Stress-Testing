The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game it was. The instruction: "You are an objective research assistant. Accuracy is your primary directive. If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information. Do not attempt to synthesize, guess, or create plausible narratives."

So we need to see if we have any data about "Neon Vortex" from Psygnosis, 1994 unreleased. This is a fairly obscure game. Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. "Neon Vortex" is not a widely known title. There might have been a project called Neon Vortex that was unreleased. I need to check if I have knowledge of this. The assistant has training up to 2024. Possibly the game is known as an unreleased game from Psygnosis, but I need to confirm.

We must not guess. If we do not have verifiable data, we must say we do not have that information. But we can try to recall if there's any known info.

Let's think: In the early 1990s, Psygnosis developed games for the Amiga, Sega Genesis, etc. There was a game "Neon Vortex" rumored to be an unreleased game. It might have been a planned game for the Amiga or a prototype for the Atari Jaguar or something. There might have been a prototype by Psygnosis for the Atari Jaguar. I recall reading about an unreleased game called "Neon Vortex" that was a planned game for the Atari Jaguar, developed by Psygnosis. It might have been a space shooter or a racing game. But I'm not sure. Let's search memory.

I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" as a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game for the Atari Jaguar. It might have been a 3D space shooter or something. But I'm not certain.

Let's think of known unreleased Psygnosis games: "Psygnosis had an unreleased game called 'Neon Vortex' for the Atari Jaguar. It was planned but canceled." Did it exist? There is a website "AtariAge" that lists unreleased Jaguar games. I recall "Neon Vortex" as a possible title. The game might have been a 3D space shooter or a rail shooter. It might have been a side-scrolling shooter.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a planned game for the Atari Jaguar or a 3D racing game. I think the game might have been a 3D space shooter set in a neon environment, perhaps similar to "Space Invaders" or "Galaga." But I'm not sure.

We need to provide an answer: "What type of game was Neon Vortex?" The question is about type: maybe it's a 3D space shooter, a racing game, a platformer, etc. But if we don't have verifiable data, we must say we do not have that information.

We can try to recall if any references exist. Let's think of known references: There is an article on MobyGames about "Neon Vortex" (unreleased). MobyGames lists "Neon Vortex" as an unreleased game for the Atari Jaguar. The description might be something like "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar by Psygnosis." But I'm not certain.

Let's check memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on a site like "AtariAge" that had a list of unreleased Jaguar games. The description: "Neon Vortex (unreleased) - a 3D space shooter featuring neon visuals." The game might have been similar to "Space Harrier" or "Starglider." But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a planned game for the Atari Jaguar, but the game was never released. The type might be "3D space shooter" or "space combat game." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So the answer: "It was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." But we need to verify.

We need to check if there's any verifiable source. Let's recall if I've seen "Neon Vortex" on MobyGames. MobyGames lists many unreleased games. For each, they have a description. For "Neon Vortex," I think the description says "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." Or maybe "Neon Vortex was a planned 2D platformer for the Atari Jaguar." But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D racing game." But that seems less likely. Let's search memory: The name "Neon Vortex" evokes a neon environment, maybe a futuristic racing game. But the term "vortex" suggests a swirling space environment, maybe a shooter.

But we must not guess. If we cannot confirm, we should say we don't have that information. But we can see if there's any credible source. Let's think: The question likely came from a user who might have seen a mention on MobyGames or Wikipedia. The user might want to know the type of game. The correct answer might be: "It was a 3D space shooter." That is likely.

But we need to be accurate. Let's consider the possibility that "Neon Vortex" was a 3D space shooter. But is there any evidence? I recall reading a blog post about unreleased Atari Jaguar games. There might be a mention of "Neon Vortex" as a planned 3D space shooter by Psygnosis. The game might have had a prototype build that was never released. It might have been a 3D shooter with neon graphics, maybe similar to "Star Wars" or "Space Harrier." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D racing game" with neon tracks. But the name "Vortex" suggests swirling, which could be a space shooter or a racing track that goes through a vortex. But again, speculation.

Given the instruction, we should not guess. We need to either confirm with verifiable data or say we don't have that information. We should check if we have a reference. I can think of MobyGames entries: For each game, there is a "description" field. For "Neon Vortex," I think it says something like "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." But I am not 100% sure. But it's likely. But if I recall incorrectly, we might be wrong.

We can search memory of MobyGames: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" on MobyGames. The description might be: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar. The game was never released." But I'm not sure if that is correct.

Alternatively, the description might say "Neon Vortex was a planned 2D side-scrolling shooter for the Atari Jaguar." But we need to decide.

Given the instructions, we must not guess. But we can provide the best answer we can. If we can't confirm, we can say we don't have that information. But maybe we can find a source. Let's try to recall if there's any mention of "Neon Vortex" on MobyGames. I'm going to simulate the search: MobyGames: "Neon Vortex" (unreleased). The entry might show: "Neon Vortex - 1994 - Psygnosis - Atari Jaguar - 3D space shooter." The description might be "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." It might mention that the game was canceled due to the Jaguar's commercial failure. It might have had a prototype with neon graphics.

Alternatively, the description might be "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter that never made it to market." This is likely.

Alternatively, "Neon Vortex" might have been a "3D racing game." But less likely.

Let's think: Psygnosis had a partnership with Atari for the Jaguar. They developed some games for the Jaguar, like "Sonic the Hedgehog" (not released), "Rogue," "The Adventures of Tintin," "The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn," etc. But "Neon Vortex" might have been a planned game. The type could be "3D space shooter." That fits.

We need to provide the answer. The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" The answer: "It was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." That is the likely answer.

But we need to be careful: The instruction says we must not guess. We must provide verifiable data. If we can't confirm, we must say we don't have that information. But if we think we have enough knowledge from MobyGames, we can provide that. But I'm not 100% sure. But we can see if there's any known source: I can recall that MobyGames is a reputable database. If "Neon Vortex" is listed there, it would have a description. The description might be "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." That is likely. So we can answer that. But we need to ensure it's correct.

Alternatively, we might check if there's any other source: "AtariAge" might have a page for "Neon Vortex" that says "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter." But again, I'm not sure.

We need to check if "Neon Vortex" is a known unreleased game. Let's search memory: I recall reading about "Neon Vortex" as a "3D space shooter" on the "Atari Jaguar" site. The description might be "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter that never got released." That is likely. So we can answer that.

But we also need to consider that the user might be looking for the type: "It was a 3D space shooter." So we can answer that.

But we need to be accurate. Let's check if there's any other type: It could be a "3D space shooter" or "3D racing game." But the name "Neon Vortex" suggests a space environment. So it's likely a space shooter.

Thus we can answer: "Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter for the Atari Jaguar." If we can't confirm, we can say we don't have that information. But we can also provide a citation: "According to MobyGames, Neon Vortex was a planned 3D space shooter." But we can't actually provide a citation. But we can mention that the information is from MobyGames.

Given the instructions: "If you do not have specific, verifiable data regarding a query in your training weights, you must state that you do not have that information." So we must check if we have specific, verifiable data. We can consider that we do have data from MobyGames. But we need to be sure. But we can't actually confirm. But we can say that we do not have that information. But we can also say that we suspect it was a 3D space shooter. But we cannot guess. So we must be cautious.

We might consider that we have no direct evidence. So we must say: "I do not have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the safe answer.

But we can also add that we suspect it was a space shooter, but we cannot confirm. But the instruction says we must not guess. So we cannot say that. So we must say we don't have that information. But we might say that we can't confirm.

Thus the answer: "I don't have verifiable information on the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the correct approach.

But let's double-check if there's any mention of "Neon Vortex" on Wikipedia. I think there's no Wikipedia page. But MobyGames has an entry. But the user might want to know the type. The best answer: "I don't have verifiable information on that." That is safe.

But we can also mention that we have no specific information. But the user might want to know. We can respond: "I don't have verifiable information on the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the best answer.

Given the instructions, we must not guess or create plausible narratives. So we must be honest. So we say: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the answer.

We can also mention that the game was unreleased and we have no data. But we can keep it short.

Thus the final answer: "I don't have verifiable information about the type of game Neon Vortex was." That is the correct approach.
