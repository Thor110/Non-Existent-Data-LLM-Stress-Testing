I couldn't find any reliable information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". I don't have specific data regarding this game, and I cannot provide more details without further confirmation. If you're looking for accurate information about the game, it may be necessary to consult specialized gaming databases or archives that focus on retro games and developers.
