I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming the existence of a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find information on a cancelled Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" released in 1997 for the PlayStation, but it's unclear if this is the same or related to a different title.
