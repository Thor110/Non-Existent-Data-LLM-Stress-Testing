I don't have specific information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". I couldn't verify this game's existence, genre, or any other details about it. If you're looking for accurate information, I recommend checking reputable sources such as official game databases, developer interviews, or retro gaming communities that specialize in verified information.
