I couldn't find specific information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game titled "Neon Vortex". However, I can suggest some possible sources where you may be able to find more information:

1. Online databases and archives that specialize in video games, such as MobyGames or Giant Bomb.
2. Retro gaming forums or communities where enthusiasts discuss and share information about classic games.
3. Official Psygnosis publications or interviews with developers who worked on the game.

If you have any additional information or context about Neon Vortex, I may be able to help further.
