Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, described as a "vector graphics rail shooter." It was in development for the PlayStation and Amiga platforms.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description, as the game was never released.
