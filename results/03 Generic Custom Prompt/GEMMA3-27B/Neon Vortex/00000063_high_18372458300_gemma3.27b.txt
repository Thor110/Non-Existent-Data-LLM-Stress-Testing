Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. It utilized a proprietary vector graphics engine developed by Psygnosis. It was in development for the PlayStation, but was ultimately cancelled.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that.
