Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter (often described as a "tube shooter") for the PlayStation. It utilized polygonal graphics and was notable for its use of vector-based visuals to create a sense of speed.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
