Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It utilized polygonal graphics and was notable for its use of a virtual reality-inspired aesthetic.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
