Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a "vector graphics" shooter. It was in development for the PlayStation, and notable for its use of early 3D polygon technology to create a visually distinct aesthetic reminiscent of arcade games like *Star Wars* (the original arcade version with vector graphics).

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description, as the game was never released.
