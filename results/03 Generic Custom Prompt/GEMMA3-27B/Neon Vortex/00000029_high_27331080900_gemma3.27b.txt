Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. Sources describe it as a fast-paced, first-person perspective game where the player navigated a series of increasingly complex, neon-lit mazes. It utilized a vector graphics style and focused on quick reflexes and spatial reasoning.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond these descriptions, as the game was never released.
