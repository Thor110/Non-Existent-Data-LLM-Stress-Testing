Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter (also described as a "3D vector shooter") for the PlayStation. It was being developed by Psygnosis in 1994 but was ultimately cancelled.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description.
