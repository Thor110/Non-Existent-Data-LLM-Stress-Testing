Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It was notable for its use of full 3D graphics and a vector-based visual style.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description, as the game was never released.
