Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, described as a hybrid of *Star Fox* and *F-Zero*. It was being developed for the PlayStation.

I do not have information regarding specific gameplay mechanics beyond that basic description, as the game was never released.
