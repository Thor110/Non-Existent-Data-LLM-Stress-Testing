Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It utilized a vector graphics style and was notable for its use of the then-new PlayStation hardware to create a visually distinct experience.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
