Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter (often described as a "vector graphics" shooter) for the PlayStation. It utilized a wireframe aesthetic and was notable for its ambitious use of early 3D polygon technology.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
