Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a rail shooter. It was in development for the PlayStation (then known as the PlayStation X) and was to utilize the console's early 3D capabilities.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description, as the game was never released.
