Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. It utilized a proprietary engine developed by Psygnosis, and gameplay revolved around navigating a 3D vector-based environment and manipulating objects to progress. 

I do not have information detailing specific game mechanics beyond that description, as it was never officially released.
