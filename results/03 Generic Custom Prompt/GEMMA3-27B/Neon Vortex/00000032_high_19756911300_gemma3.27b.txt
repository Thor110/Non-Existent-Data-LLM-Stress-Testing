Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It was in development by Psygnosis in 1994 but was ultimately cancelled. 

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that basic genre description.
