Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a "vector graphics" or "wireframe" shooter. It was in development for the PlayStation, and was notable for its use of early 3D polygon technology to create a fast-paced, psychedelic visual experience.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
