Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or a "3D vector shooter," for the PlayStation. It was heavily inspired by the arcade game *Star Fox* (known as *Star Wing* in PAL regions).

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description, as the game was never released.
