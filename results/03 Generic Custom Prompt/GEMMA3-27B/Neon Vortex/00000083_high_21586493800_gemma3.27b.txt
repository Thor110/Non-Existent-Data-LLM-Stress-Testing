Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, also described as a "vector graphics racer." It was in development for the PlayStation by Psygnosis. 

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that. As it was unreleased, comprehensive details are scarce.
