Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It utilized a vector graphics style and was notable for its use of translucent polygons and early implementation of texture filtering.

I do not have information regarding specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
