Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. Sources describe it as a first-person perspective game where the player navigated abstract, neon-lit environments, manipulating blocks and solving puzzles to progress. It utilized a proprietary engine developed by Psygnosis.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
