Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. Sources describe it as a first-person perspective game where the player navigated a series of increasingly complex, neon-lit mazes, manipulating blocks and solving puzzles to progress. It utilized a proprietary engine designed to create vector graphics, giving it a distinct visual style.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond these descriptions, as the game was never officially released.
