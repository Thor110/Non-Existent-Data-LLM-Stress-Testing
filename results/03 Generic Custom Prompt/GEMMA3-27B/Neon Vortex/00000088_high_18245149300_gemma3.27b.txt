Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle game utilizing a first-person perspective. It was in development by Psygnosis for the PlayStation, but was ultimately cancelled. 

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description.
