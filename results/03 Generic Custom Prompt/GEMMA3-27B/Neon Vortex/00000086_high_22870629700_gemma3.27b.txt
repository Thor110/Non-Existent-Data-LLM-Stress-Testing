Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter game. It was in development by Psygnosis for the PlayStation, but was ultimately cancelled. Sources describe it as a fast-paced, vector graphics-based shooter with a focus on speed and intense action.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description.
