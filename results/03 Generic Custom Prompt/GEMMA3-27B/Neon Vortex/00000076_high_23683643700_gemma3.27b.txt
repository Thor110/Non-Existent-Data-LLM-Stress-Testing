Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, similar to *Star Wars Arcade* and *Virtua Cop*. It was being developed for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.

I do not have information beyond this basic genre and platform description. Details regarding specific gameplay mechanics beyond "3D scrolling shooter" are not present in my training data.
