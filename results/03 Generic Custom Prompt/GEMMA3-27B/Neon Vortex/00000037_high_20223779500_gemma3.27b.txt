Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, also described as a "tube shooter." It was in development for the PlayStation by Psygnosis in 1994 but was ultimately cancelled.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description.
