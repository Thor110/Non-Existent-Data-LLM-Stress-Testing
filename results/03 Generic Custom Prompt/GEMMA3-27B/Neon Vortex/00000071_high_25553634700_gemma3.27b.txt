Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. It utilized a proprietary engine called "RenVision" and was designed for the PlayStation. Sources describe gameplay involving navigating a 3D maze-like environment with a focus on speed and collecting items.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond these broad descriptions, as the game was never released.
