Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, or a "3D vector shooter," for the PlayStation. It utilized a wireframe vector graphics style, similar to *Star Fox* on the SNES, but with fully polygonal environments – a relatively ambitious undertaking for the early PlayStation.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description.
