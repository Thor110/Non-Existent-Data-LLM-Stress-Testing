Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a rail shooter, for the PlayStation. It utilized a proprietary graphics technology called "texture mapping" to create a sense of speed and depth.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
