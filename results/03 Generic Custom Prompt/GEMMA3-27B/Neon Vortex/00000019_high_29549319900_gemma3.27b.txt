Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. It utilized a proprietary engine developed by Psygnosis, and was notable for its use of full 3D polygonal graphics – a relatively advanced feature for the time, particularly on the Amiga platform it was primarily being developed for.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond that general description. The game was never released, and detailed public demonstrations are scarce.
