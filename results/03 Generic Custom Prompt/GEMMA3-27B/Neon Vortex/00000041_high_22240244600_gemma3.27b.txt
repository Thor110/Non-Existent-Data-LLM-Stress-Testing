Based on available information, Neon Vortex was intended to be a 3D puzzle/action game. It utilized a vector graphics style and was in development for the PlayStation. It was to feature a futuristic setting with players navigating complex, rotating mazes.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
