Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, also described as a "3D vector graphics arcade-style shoot 'em up." It was in development for the PlayStation.

I do not have information beyond this basic genre description. Details regarding specific gameplay mechanics or further sub-genre classification are not present in my training data.
