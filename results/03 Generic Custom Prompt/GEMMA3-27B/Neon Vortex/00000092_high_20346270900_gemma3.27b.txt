Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D scrolling shooter, often described as a rail shooter. It was in development for the PlayStation, and utilized early 3D polygon graphics.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond this general description, as the game was never released.
