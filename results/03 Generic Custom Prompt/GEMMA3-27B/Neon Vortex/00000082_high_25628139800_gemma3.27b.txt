Based on available information, *Neon Vortex* was intended to be a 3D puzzle game with racing elements. It utilized a proprietary engine developed by Psygnosis, and was designed for the PlayStation. It featured vector graphics and a focus on navigating complex, neon-lit courses.

I do not have information detailing specific gameplay mechanics beyond these broad descriptions, as the game was never released.
