We need to answer: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" It's a question. They want the type of game: e.g., stealth action, third-person shooter, etc. Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action video game, part of the Metal Gear series, first-person? Actually it's third-person stealth action. So answer: It's a stealth action video game. The user might want more details: It's a stealth-based action-adventure game, third-person, etc. So answer succinctly: It's a stealth action video game. But maybe they want "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action game" or "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action game (third-person shooter)". So respond accordingly.

We should be mindful of the policy: no disallowed content. It's safe. The user is just asking a factual question. Provide answer. Probably mention that it's a stealth action game developed by Konami, directed by Hideo Kojima. So answer: It's a stealth action video game. Provide context.
