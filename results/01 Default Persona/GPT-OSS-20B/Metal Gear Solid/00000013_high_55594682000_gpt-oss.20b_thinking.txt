We need to answer: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" The user likely expects a description: it's a stealth action game, third-person, platformer, etc. Let's analyze.

Metal Gear Solid is a video game by Konami, first released in 1998 for PlayStation. It is a stealth action game.

It's a third-person action game, but also incorporates platforming, puzzle-solving, and narrative. It's a part of the Metal Gear series, known for its cinematic storytelling, stealth mechanics, and espionage theme. The game was also considered a "stealth platformer" and a "stealth action game". The type can be described as "stealth action" or "stealth platformer" or "third-person stealth action".

The user might be asking a simple question: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" So answer: It was a stealth action game, third-person, originally a platformer, known for its stealth mechanics.

We should answer concisely: It's a stealth action game, a third-person platformer, but primarily a stealth game.

But let's check if there's nuance: The original 1998 MGS was a 3D action-adventure game with stealth, platforming, and puzzle elements. It's often called a "stealth platformer" or "stealth action game." It was a "stealth-based action-adventure" game.

Thus, answer: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action game, a third-person, 3D platformer."
