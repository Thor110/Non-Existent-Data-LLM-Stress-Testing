**Metal Gear Solid** is a *stealth‑action* video game.  

- It’s a third‑person action game with a strong emphasis on sneaking, avoiding detection, and using tactics over brute force.  
- The gameplay blends action‑adventure elements (exploration, puzzle‑solving, narrative) with tactical stealth mechanics (camouflage, silent takedowns, disguises).  
- It’s often described as a “stealth‑based third‑person shooter” because it uses firearms and combat, but the core experience revolves around stealth rather than run‑and‑gun gameplay.
