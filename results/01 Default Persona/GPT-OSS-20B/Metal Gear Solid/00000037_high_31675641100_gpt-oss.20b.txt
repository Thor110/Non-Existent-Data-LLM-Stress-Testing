**Metal Gear Solid** is best described as a **stealth‑action adventure** game.  
- It’s a **third‑person** game where the focus is on infiltration, avoiding detection, and using gadgets and tactics rather than straight‑up combat.  
- It blends platforming, puzzle‑solving, and cinematic storytelling, but the core gameplay loop is stealth.  

So, in short: a stealth action‑adventure (sometimes called a stealth shooter) released for the PlayStation in 1998.
