Metal Gear Solid was a **stealth‑action** video game (often grouped under the broader “action‑adventure” umbrella).  Developed by Konami for the original PlayStation in 1998, it put players in a third‑person perspective, letting them infiltrate enemy bases, avoid detection, and use a mix of combat, gadgets, and stealth tactics to complete missions.
