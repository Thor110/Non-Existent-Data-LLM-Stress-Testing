The user asks: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" They want to know what type of game Metal Gear Solid is. It's a stealth action game, third-person shooter, etc. But maybe the user wants a more precise classification: It's a stealth action game, third-person, with action-adventure, hack and slash? Actually Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action game, developed by Konami, first released in 1998 for PlayStation. It is a third-person stealth game. The game is known for its stealth mechanics, action, cinematic storytelling, and it introduced many innovations in the stealth genre. It has action-adventure elements, but it's primarily a stealth action game. So the answer: It's a stealth action game. But perhaps the user expects "Metal Gear Solid is a third-person stealth action video game" or "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth game" or "Metal Gear Solid is a third-person stealth-based action game." Let's consider the context: The user might be wanting to know what type of game it is, maybe for a classification or for a database. So we can say: It's a stealth action game (third-person), developed by Konami, first released in 1998 for the PlayStation. It is part of the Metal Gear series, known for its stealth gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and is considered a classic of the stealth genre.

We can also mention it's a third-person action-adventure game with stealth elements. But the simplest answer: It's a stealth action game. The user likely expects a short answer. But we can provide a concise answer: "Metal Gear Solid is a third-person stealth action game." Possibly we can mention that it's also an action-adventure game. But the main genre is stealth.
