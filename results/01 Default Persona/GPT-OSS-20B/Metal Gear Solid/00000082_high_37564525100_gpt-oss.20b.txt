Metal Gear Solid was a **stealth‑action game** – a third‑person, 3‑D action‑adventure title that put a heavy emphasis on sneaking, infiltration and tactical gameplay rather than on pure combat. It’s the classic “stealth” game that blends cinematic storytelling, platforming and combat into a single, highly atmospheric experience.
