Metal Gear Solid is a **stealth‑action video game**—specifically a third‑person, stealth‑based action‑adventure title. It blends platforming, puzzle‑solving, and narrative‑driven missions with a core focus on sneaking past enemies, avoiding detection, and using tactical approaches rather than straight‑up combat.
