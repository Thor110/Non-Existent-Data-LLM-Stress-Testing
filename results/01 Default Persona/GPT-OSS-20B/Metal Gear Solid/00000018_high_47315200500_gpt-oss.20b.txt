**Metal Gear Solid was a stealth‑action video game.**  

It’s a third‑person action‑adventure title that puts a heavy emphasis on stealth gameplay: infiltrating enemy bases, avoiding detection, using cover and silent takedowns, and planning missions with a mix of strategy and real‑time action. The game is often described as a “stealth platformer” or “stealth‑based action‑adventure,” but its core identity is that of a stealth action game.
