We need to answer: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" The user likely wants a brief answer: "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game." It's a stealth video game. Could mention it is a third-person action game with stealth elements. The user might want more detail: "It is a stealth-based action-adventure game developed by Konami, first released in 1998 for PlayStation." But the question: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" So we answer: "It was a stealth action-adventure game." Or "It was a stealth-based action game." If we want to be more specific: "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth-based action-adventure video game." We can also mention the genre: "Stealth, action, third-person." The answer: "It was a stealth action-adventure game." That should suffice. However, maybe the user expects "It was a stealth video game." But to be safe: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action-adventure game." We can add a bit: "It was a third-person action game that emphasized stealth gameplay." That would be a good answer.

We should consider that the user might want the type of game: "It was a stealth action game." So we answer accordingly. No need for extra context. The question is simple. But we can add: "It was a stealth-based action-adventure game released by Konami." But we can keep it concise.
