Metal Gear Solid was a **stealth‑action game** – a third‑person, action‑adventure title that emphasizes sneaking, tactical planning, and stealth gameplay over straight‑up shooting. It also blends in platforming, puzzle‑solving, and a cinematic narrative, but at its core it’s a stealth‑focused action game.
