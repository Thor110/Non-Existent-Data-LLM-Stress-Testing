We need to answer: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" The user likely expects a description of the genre or style: action-adventure stealth game, third-person stealth action, etc. Let's consider context: They might be asking a simple question: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" They might want: "Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action game" or "It is a stealth-based third-person action game." Also, the game is part of the Metal Gear series by Hideo Kojima, known for stealth gameplay. So answer: It is a stealth action game, with third-person perspective, puzzle elements, etc.

But maybe they want a classification: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action game, third-person shooter, with a focus on stealth, infiltration, and tactical gameplay." Or "It was a stealth action-adventure game."

Alternatively, the answer could be: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth-based action-adventure video game."

Alternatively, "Metal Gear Solid was a third-person stealth action game."

Alternatively, "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action game developed by Konami for the PlayStation."

Alternatively, "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action game with a strong narrative and cinematic elements."

Also, the user might ask "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" They might want the classification: "Stealth action" or "Action-adventure" or "Action" or "Shooter."

Let's think: The game is known for stealth gameplay. It's a third-person action-adventure game with stealth elements. It's often described as a stealth action game. So answer: "It was a stealth action game." Provide additional context: "It was a third-person stealth action game that introduced cinematic storytelling and gameplay mechanics."

Thus, answer: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action video game (third-person) that emphasized infiltration, tactical combat, and narrative-driven gameplay."

Thus, I can answer: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth-based action-adventure game, specifically a third-person stealth action game." The user might be expecting a simple answer. So respond accordingly.

But let's consider if they want a more specific type: "It was a stealth action game with cinematic cutscenes." Or "It was a stealth action game for the PlayStation."

Thus, answer: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action game (third-person) that combined action, adventure, and stealth gameplay." That covers it.

But the question: "What type of game was Metal Gear Solid?" The answer: "It was a stealth action game." They might want to know "It was a stealth-based action game." So answer that. Also mention "Third-person perspective." So final answer: "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth action video game, a third-person action-adventure game that focuses on infiltration and tactical combat." Or "Metal Gear Solid was a stealth-based action-adventure game." That should satisfy.

Thus, final.
