Neon Vortex was being built as a **3‑D first‑person action game** – essentially a cyber‑punk shooter/adventure for the 3DO.  The cancelled title was pitched as a fully‑3D, first‑person perspective game with a gritty, neon‑lit, cyber‑punk setting, and it was intended to play like the early 90s shooters of the era.
