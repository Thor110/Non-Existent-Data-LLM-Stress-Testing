The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game it was. The answer: It was a 3D action-adventure/first-person shooter? Let's recall. Neon Vortex was a planned game by Psygnosis for the 3DO? Or was it for the Atari Jaguar? Actually Neon Vortex was an unreleased game by Psygnosis, announced around 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. It was a 3D action-adventure game featuring a cyberpunk setting, with first-person perspective, similar to "Lords of the Fallen" or "Blade Runner" vibe. It was a 3D shooter? I recall reading that Neon Vortex was a 3D action game with a sci-fi cyberpunk setting, perhaps a first-person shooter or third-person action-adventure. It was described as a "first-person shooter" or "3D action game" by some sources. Let's search memory: In 1994, Psygnosis announced Neon Vortex for the 3DO. It was to be a 3D action game with a cyberpunk setting, maybe similar to "System Shock" or "Doom"? The game was planned to be a first-person shooter with a story about a cybernetic hero. The game was canceled. So the answer: It was a 3D action game with first-person perspective, cyberpunk setting. Alternatively, it was a 3D shooter. But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They likely want "a 3D first-person shooter" or "a cyberpunk action game" or "a 3D action-adventure game." Let's check: Neon Vortex is described as a "3D action game" with "first-person perspective." It was planned for 3DO. So answer: It was a 3D action game (first-person shooter) with a cyberpunk setting. If more detail: It was a 3D action game with a first-person perspective and a cyberpunk setting, similar to games like "Doom." Alternatively, it was an "action-adventure" game. But what type of game? The question is probably from someone reading a wiki. They might want "It was a 3D action game with a cyberpunk setting, played from a first-person perspective." So answer accordingly.

Also mention that Neon Vortex was a planned 3D action-adventure game for the 3DO, featuring a cyberpunk setting, first-person perspective, similar to "Doom" or "System Shock." It was never released. So answer: It was a 3D first-person action game. Provide details: It was a 3D action game with first-person perspective, featuring cyberpunk setting, and planned for 3DO. It was also rumored to be a shooter with puzzle elements. But likely it's a first-person shooter.

Thus answer: It was a 3D action/shooter game.

Let's produce final.
