**Neon Vortex was a first‑person shooter (FPS).**  

The game was being developed by Psygnosis for the Atari Jaguar in 1994. It was intended to be a 3‑D action‑shooter with a neon‑themed aesthetic, drawing inspiration from early Doom‑style titles. Unfortunately, the Jaguar’s commercial troubles and the shifting focus of Psygnosis meant that the game never made it past the prototype stage.
