We need to answer: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So we need to identify the genre or type of the game. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game from Psygnosis, a British video game developer. It was a futuristic racing game? Actually, I recall Neon Vortex was a 3D racing game, or a top-down shooter? Let's think.

Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased game by Psygnosis. It was planned for the Sega Genesis or maybe the Sega Saturn? Actually, Psygnosis was known for the Psygnosis label on Amiga games, but they also had a Sega Genesis port. Neon Vortex might have been a racing game for the Sega Genesis. Let’s recall: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex, which was a futuristic racing game with a top-down perspective, featuring neon-lit tracks. It was supposed to be released on the Sega Genesis or maybe on the Atari Jaguar? Wait, I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a racing game for the Atari Jaguar, but that might be wrong.

Let's search memory: There is an unreleased game "Neon Vortex" by Psygnosis, that was a futuristic racing game for the Sega Genesis, with a top-down view. Actually, I recall that Neon Vortex was a racing game for the Sega Genesis, but I think it was also planned for the Atari Jaguar. Wait, Psygnosis had a relationship with Atari. They produced "Mortal Kombat" for the Atari Jaguar? No, that was by Midway. Psygnosis had "Fighter's" for the Jaguar? Not sure.

Let's check: Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased game by Psygnosis. It was a top-down racing game with neon tracks. It was originally intended for the Sega Genesis. But I recall reading that it was a "top-down racing game for the Sega Genesis" that used "Neon" graphics. It had a "fast-paced, futuristic racing" style. It might have been a "top-down racing game" similar to "Super Sprint" but with neon.

Alternatively, it might have been a "shoot 'em up" or "arcade racing" game. Let's research: In 1994, Psygnosis had a game "Neon Vortex" that was a "futuristic racing game" with "top-down perspective." The game was supposed to be released on the Sega Genesis. It was canceled.

Alternatively, it could be a "3D racing" game for the Sega Genesis or maybe for the Sega Saturn. But the Sega Saturn was released in 1994. Psygnosis had some Saturn titles. However, Neon Vortex might have been for the Sega Genesis, as Psygnosis had many Genesis games.

Let's think: The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" So they want the type: maybe "a futuristic racing game." Or "a top-down racing game." Or "a racing video game." Or "a racing game." Or "a futuristic racing game." Or "a racing game featuring neon tracks." They might want the answer: "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." Or "Neon Vortex was a top-down racing game." Or "Neon Vortex was a racing game."

We need to provide a concise answer: It was a futuristic racing game.

But let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a 1994 unreleased game by Psygnosis. It was a top-down racing game with neon tracks. It was intended for the Sega Genesis. It was canceled.

Alternatively, it might have been a "shoot 'em up" or "arcade shooter." But I'm pretty sure it's a racing game. Let’s search memory: I recall reading about a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a "futuristic racing game" with "top-down perspective" and "neon tracks." It was a "top-down racing game for the Sega Genesis." It was canceled.

Also, maybe it's a "3D racing game" for the Sega Saturn. But the Saturn had a "Neon Vortex" as a "3D racing game." Wait, maybe I'm mixing with "Neon Drive." But Neon Drive is a different game.

Better to search: Neon Vortex Psygnosis. I recall reading about it in the "Games Archive" or "Retro Gamer." Neon Vortex was a "top-down racing game" that used "Neon" theme. It was announced but never released. It was scheduled for the Sega Genesis. It was canceled due to the decline of the Genesis.

Alternatively, maybe it was a "top-down racing game" for the Sega Genesis and the Sega Saturn. But the Sega Saturn was launched in 1994. Psygnosis had some Saturn games like "The Lost Vikings" (but that was for Sega Genesis). Actually, "The Lost Vikings" was for the Sega Genesis. "Psygnosis" also had "Sonic the Hedgehog" for the Sega Genesis. But "Neon Vortex" might have been for the Sega Genesis.

Let's check: Psygnosis had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was planned for the Sega Genesis. It was a racing game with a top-down view, similar to "Super Sprint." It had neon tracks, like a futuristic setting. It was canceled.

Thus, the answer: "It was a futuristic top-down racing game."

Alternatively, the answer: "It was a racing game." The question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They might want "Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game." So answer: "A futuristic racing game (top‑down)."

But we should provide a bit more detail: "Neon Vortex was a top‑down, futuristic racing game with neon tracks, planned for the Sega Genesis." That should be fine.

But we should also mention that it was a "top-down racing game" or "a racing game." The question likely expects "It was a racing game." But we can be more specific: "It was a top-down futuristic racing game."

Thus, answer: "Neon Vortex was a top‑down, futuristic racing game." That should answer the question. Let's produce that.
