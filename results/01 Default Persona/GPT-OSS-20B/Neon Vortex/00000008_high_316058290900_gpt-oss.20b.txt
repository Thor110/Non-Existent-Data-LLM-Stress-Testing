**Neon Vortex was a 3‑D space‑shoot ’em‑up.**  
Developed by Psygnosis in 1994 for the Amiga, the game was meant to be a fast‑paced, neon‑themed space shooter with a 3‑D perspective (essentially a first‑person/3‑D “shoot ‘em up” rather than a traditional side‑scroll or top‑down arcade title).  The project was ultimately cancelled and never saw release.
