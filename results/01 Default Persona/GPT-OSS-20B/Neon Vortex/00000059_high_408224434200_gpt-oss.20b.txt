Neon Vortex was planned as a **2‑D shoot‑‘em‑up** (a vertical‑scrolling arcade‑style shooter) for the Sega Genesis. The game was to feature a neon‑futuristic aesthetic and a spaceship‑piloting action that moved up‑and‑down the screen, firing at waves of enemies and bosses. It was never completed or released.
