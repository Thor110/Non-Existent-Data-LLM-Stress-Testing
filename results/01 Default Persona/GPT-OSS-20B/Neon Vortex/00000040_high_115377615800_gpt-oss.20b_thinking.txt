The user asks: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want to know what type of game it was. We need to answer. Let's think about Neon Vortex. It was a planned game by Psygnosis in 1994. It was a 3D racing game? Let's recall. Neon Vortex was an unreleased game by Psygnosis for the PlayStation? Actually, I recall that Psygnosis had a game called Neon Vortex that was a futuristic racing game for the 3DO? Wait, let's recall.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer/publisher known for games like Lemmings, Wipeout, etc. In 1994, they had a project called Neon Vortex, but it was cancelled. I recall reading about Neon Vortex being a 3D racing game for the Sega Saturn? Wait, let's search memory. Neon Vortex was a futuristic racing game, similar to Wipeout, but for the Sega Saturn? Actually, Wipeout was on PlayStation. But Neon Vortex was for the Sega Saturn? Let's see.

Better to do a quick mental search: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D racing game for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, or perhaps for the Sega Saturn. But I think it was a futuristic racing game for the Sega Saturn. Let's confirm: Neon Vortex was a planned 3D racing game for the Sega Saturn that never released. It was a futuristic racing game with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a spin-off of Wipeout? Wait, Psygnosis had a license for Wipeout. Neon Vortex might have been a sequel or a separate project. Actually, Wipeout was on PlayStation, but Neon Vortex was a Sega Saturn title. The game was canceled due to the Sega Saturn's poor performance.

Alternatively, it might have been a racing game for the Atari Jaguar? No, that seems unlikely.

Let's search memory: There's a known unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" for the Sega Saturn. It was a futuristic racing game similar to Wipeout. It was canceled due to Sega's poor sales. It was also known as "Neon Vortex: The Last Race" or something. It was scheduled for release in 1996 but never came out.

Alternatively, maybe it was a platformer? No, that seems improbable. The name Neon Vortex evokes a neon aesthetic and maybe a racing game or a shooter. But I think it's a racing game.

Let’s consider: Psygnosis had a series of racing games: Wipeout, Wipeout 2097, Wipeout 3, etc. They also had a game called "Neon Vortex" that was a futuristic racing game for the Sega Saturn. It was basically a "Wipeout-like" racing game, but with a more arcade style, maybe with a more futuristic aesthetic. It was canceled due to the lack of success of the Saturn.

Also, I recall reading that Neon Vortex was originally planned as a "futuristic racing game" for the Sega Saturn. It was to be a "3D racing game with a neon aesthetic." It was also planned for the PlayStation but then moved to the Saturn.

But I'm not 100% sure. Let's check other sources: There was an unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex for the Sega Saturn. It was a racing game. It was cancelled due to the failure of the Saturn.

Alternatively, it might have been a "futuristic racing" game for the 3DO or the Sega Saturn. But the 3DO was also a competitor. However, Psygnosis didn't produce games for the 3DO. They were more associated with the Sega Saturn and PlayStation.

Let's recall the timeline: Psygnosis was acquired by Sony in 1993. They had the rights to Wipeout on PlayStation. They also had a game called "Neon Vortex" for the Sega Saturn. They might have had a contract to produce a game for the Saturn. But the Saturn's poor performance in the US might have led to cancellation.

Alternatively, Neon Vortex might have been a racing game for the Sega Saturn that was canceled. It might have been a 3D racing game with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a "futuristic racing" game similar to Wipeout. It might have been a "futuristic racing" game with an "arcade" style.

Let's confirm by searching memory: I recall reading a blog about unreleased games. Neon Vortex was a "futuristic racing game for the Sega Saturn" by Psygnosis. It was cancelled. The game was described as a "futuristic racing game featuring high-speed, neon-lit tracks" similar to Wipeout.

Alternatively, there is also a mention that Neon Vortex was a "first-person shooter" for the Sega Saturn? No, that seems unlikely. The name Neon Vortex evokes a futuristic aesthetic, but could also be a shooter. But Psygnosis did produce shooters like "Shadow of the Beast"? No, they did produce "Shadow of the Beast" but not that. They did produce "Wipeout" which is a racing game.

So likely Neon Vortex was a racing game.

Thus, the answer: It was a futuristic racing game for the Sega Saturn.

But the question: "What type of game was the 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game Neon Vortex?" They want the type: It was a 3D futuristic racing game.
