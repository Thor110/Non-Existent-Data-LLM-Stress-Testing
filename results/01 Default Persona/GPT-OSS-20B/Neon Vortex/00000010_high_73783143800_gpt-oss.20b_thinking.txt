It might have been a 3D shooter. The game was rumored to have been a first-person shooter with a neon aesthetic. It might have been a third-person shooter? Let's think: Psygnosis had a 3D engine called "Psygnosis 3D Engine" used for Wipeout and Lemmings. Neon Vortex might have been a first-person shooter like "Descent" or "Doom."
