Neon Vortex was intended to be a **3‑D space shooter** – essentially a first‑person “shmup” in which the player pilots a ship through a neon‑lit vortex, battling enemies and collecting power‑ups. The title was being developed for the Atari Jaguar in 1994, but it never made it past the prototype stage.
