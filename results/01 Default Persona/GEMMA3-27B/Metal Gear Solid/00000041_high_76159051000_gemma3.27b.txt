Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is certainly present.  Solid Snake can fight enemies with various weapons, though doing so often attracts more attention.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its long, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It's often cited as a pioneer in cinematic storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** The game features relatively large environments to explore, with secrets and items to find.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are puzzles throughout the game, often involving finding codes, manipulating the environment, or using items in clever ways.



Essentially, it's a game that *defined* the stealth action genre and pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games. It's far more than just running and gunning!
