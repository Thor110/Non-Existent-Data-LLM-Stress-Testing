* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation and use cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and often necessary. It's a third-person shooter with a focus on tactical engagements.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is renowned for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, complex narrative, and political themes. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress, often involving finding keycards, deciphering codes, or manipulating the environment.

**Essentially, it's a pioneering title that helped define the stealth action genre and is known for its cinematic presentation and intricate story.**  It wasn't *just* about shooting; it was about *how* you approached situations and the narrative unfolding around you.
