Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to bypass enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand fighting, and the use of various gadgets. However, going in guns blazing is usually a recipe for disaster.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic presentation and complex, politically-charged story. It heavily influenced the industry's approach to narrative in games.
* **Exploration:**  The game features environments to explore, often with multiple routes and secrets to discover.
* **Boss Battles:**  Iconic and challenging boss fights are a major component.

While it has elements of other genres, **action stealth** best encapsulates the core experience of Metal Gear Solid. It's often credited with popularizing and refining the stealth genre in video games.
