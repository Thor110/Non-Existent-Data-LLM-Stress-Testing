Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key characteristics:

* **Action:** It involves combat, exploration, and completing objectives. You control Solid Snake, and there's plenty of shooting, fighting, and navigating environments.
* **Stealth:**  This is *core* to the gameplay.  Metal Gear Solid popularized the idea of avoiding direct confrontation.  You're encouraged (and often *required*) to sneak past enemies, use cover, distract guards, and avoid detection.  Being spotted leads to difficult fights, so remaining hidden is paramount.

However, it's also important to note that Metal Gear Solid goes beyond just being an action stealth game. It incorporates elements of:

* **Cinematic Cutscenes:**  The game is famous for its long, detailed cutscenes that drive a complex and political story.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  You often need to solve puzzles to progress, finding items and figuring out how to use them.
* **Boss Battles:**  Epic and memorable boss fights with unique mechanics.



So, while "action stealth" is the most accurate description, it's a game that blended genres to create a truly unique experience.
