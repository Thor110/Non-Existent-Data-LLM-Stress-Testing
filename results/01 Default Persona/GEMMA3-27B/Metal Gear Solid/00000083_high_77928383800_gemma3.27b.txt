Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining feature. Players are encouraged (and often required) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is central, combat is definitely present. When detected, or when choosing to engage, players can use a variety of weapons and tactics.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It wasn't just about gameplay; it was a narrative-driven experience.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is the subgenre Hideo Kojima, the creator, often used to describe the series. It emphasizes strategic thinking, planning, and utilizing gadgets.
* **Exploration:** The game features interconnected environments to explore, often with secrets and hidden items.



While it has elements of other genres, like run and gun, it's most accurately categorized as an action stealth game that heavily emphasizes tactical espionage and a compelling story. It's considered a pioneer and hugely influential in the stealth genre.
