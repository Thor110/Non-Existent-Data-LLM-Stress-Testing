Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends several genres together, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting and hand-to-hand combat. However, going in guns blazing is often a losing strategy.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, political storyline. It pushed the boundaries of narrative in video games.
* **Exploration:**  The environments are large and complex, encouraging exploration for items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements integrated into the gameplay.

**Essentially, it's a third-person action game where stealth is prioritized, but with a *very* strong emphasis on story and cinematic presentation.** It's considered a foundational title in the stealth genre and heavily influenced many games that followed.
