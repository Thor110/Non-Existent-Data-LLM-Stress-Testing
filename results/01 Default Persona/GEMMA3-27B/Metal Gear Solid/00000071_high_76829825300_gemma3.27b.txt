Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than that! Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. You're encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to move through levels unseen.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. You have weapons and can engage enemies directly, but it's often a last resort.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling, blurring the lines between game and movie.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** Levels aren't just linear paths. You explore environments, find items, and solve puzzles to progress.
* **Boss Battles:** Epic and memorable boss fights are a signature part of the series, often requiring unique strategies to defeat.

**Genre Blending:** It's often described as a blend of:

* **Stealth Action**
* **Tactical Action**
* **Cinematic Adventure**



It really *defined* the stealth action genre and influenced many games that came after it.
