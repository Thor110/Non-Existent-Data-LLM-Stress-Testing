Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's a bit more complex than *just* that. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies.  You're encouraged to sneak past guards, use cover, and utilize distractions.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is preferred, the game *does* allow for direct combat.  You can fight enemies, but it's often risky and less effective than avoiding them.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex narrative, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environments to explore and puzzles to solve, often requiring you to find items or manipulate the environment.
* **Boss Battles:**  Memorable and challenging boss fights are a key component of the game.

**In essence, it pioneered the stealth action genre and is considered a landmark title in video game history.**  It blended elements from other genres, but its emphasis on tactical espionage and cinematic presentation set it apart.
