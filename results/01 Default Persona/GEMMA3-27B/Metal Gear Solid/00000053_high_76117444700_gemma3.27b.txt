Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, blending several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation and use tactics like hiding, camouflage, and distraction to navigate levels and complete objectives.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  The game features third-person shooting, melee combat, and a variety of weapons.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  Levels often contain puzzles that need to be solved to progress, involving item usage, code entry, and environmental manipulation.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, the game has a sense of vulnerability and limited resources, reminiscent of survival horror.  You're often outnumbered and need to be careful.



It's often credited with **popularizing the stealth action genre** and setting a new standard for cinematic presentation in video games.
