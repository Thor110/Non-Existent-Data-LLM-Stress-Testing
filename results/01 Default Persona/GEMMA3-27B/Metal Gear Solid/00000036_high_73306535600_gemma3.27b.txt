Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends several genres together, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are heavily encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and becomes necessary at times. It features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  The game features large environments to explore, with secrets and items hidden throughout.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles to solve, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.

**Essentially, it's an action game *defined* by its stealth mechanics and elevated by its cinematic presentation and story.** It's considered a pioneer in the stealth action genre and heavily influenced many games that followed.
