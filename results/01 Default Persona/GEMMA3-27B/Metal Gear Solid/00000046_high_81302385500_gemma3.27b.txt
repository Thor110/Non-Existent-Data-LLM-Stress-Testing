Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies. This was *highly* innovative for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, combat *is* possible.  Players can engage enemies with weapons, but doing so often attracts more attention and makes the game harder.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling, pushing the boundaries of what was expected in video games. It's often credited with helping to popularize cinematic storytelling in games.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environments to explore and puzzles to solve, adding another layer of complexity beyond just sneaking and shooting.
* **Top-Down Perspective with 3D Environments:** It used a fixed camera perspective (though dynamic) within fully 3D environments, a relatively new concept at the time.



While it has elements of other genres, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining categorization.  It essentially *created* a subgenre within action games.
