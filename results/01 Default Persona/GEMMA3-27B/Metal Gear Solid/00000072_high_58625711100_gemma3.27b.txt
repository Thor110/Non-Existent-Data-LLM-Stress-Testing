Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very influential game that blended genres, so it's also described as:

*   **Stealth Action:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *need*) to avoid direct confrontation and use cover, camouflage, and distraction to progress.
*   **Action:** While stealth is key, combat is definitely present and can be used, though it's often more challenging than a pure action game.
*   **Cinematic Action:** *Metal Gear Solid* was groundbreaking for its cinematic presentation, using camera angles, cutscenes, and a complex narrative more akin to a movie than most games of its time.
*   **Adventure:** The game involves exploration, puzzle-solving, and a strong narrative focus.

Essentially, it pioneered the stealth action genre and pushed boundaries in storytelling and presentation for video games.
