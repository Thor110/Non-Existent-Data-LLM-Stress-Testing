Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than *just* that. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past guards rather than engage in direct combat. This was a *major* innovation for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is prioritized, combat *is* possible. Players have weapons and can engage enemies, but it's often risky and not the intended primary approach.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and character development – blurring the lines between video game and movie.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environments to explore, and players often need to solve puzzles to progress, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.
* **Fourth-Wall Breaking:** Hideo Kojima, the creator, famously included elements that directly addressed the player, breaking the fourth wall and adding a unique meta-narrative.



Essentially, it established a new subgenre within action games, emphasizing strategic thinking, planning, and avoidance over brute force.  It's considered a hugely influential title and a pioneer of the stealth action genre.
