Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very complex game that blends several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* present. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though it's often a last resort.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its long, elaborate cutscenes and a complex, politically-charged story. This pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games at the time.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed to be explored, finding items, secrets, and alternative routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and challenges that need to be solved to progress.

Essentially, it pioneered what became known as the **stealth action genre**.  It's much more than just sneaking around though; it's a cinematic, story-driven experience with a lot of depth.
