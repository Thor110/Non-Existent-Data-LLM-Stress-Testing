Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key elements:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake and engage in firefights, though direct confrontation is often discouraged.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining feature. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding detection by enemies. You're encouraged to use cover, camouflage, distractions, and silent takedowns to progress.  Being seen often leads to difficult battles, so staying hidden is crucial.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, finding items, shortcuts, and secrets.
* **Boss Battles:** Iconic and challenging boss fights are a major part of the experience.

While it has action elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter.  The core gameplay loop revolves around *avoiding* conflict whenever possible.  



It's often considered a pioneer of the stealth genre, and heavily influenced many games that followed.
