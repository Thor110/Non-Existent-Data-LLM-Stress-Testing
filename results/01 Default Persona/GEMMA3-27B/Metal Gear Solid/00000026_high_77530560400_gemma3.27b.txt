Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and vehicle sections.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in terms of its cinematic presentation and complex, political storyline. It heavily used cutscenes and dialogue to develop characters and plot.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game includes puzzles to unlock doors, disable security systems, and progress the story.



Essentially, it's a game that *prioritizes* stealth, but isn't afraid to throw in action, storytelling, and puzzle elements to create a unique and immersive experience. It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre.
