Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and it pioneered many elements that define the genre today. Here's a breakdown of what it was and how it played:

*   **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolved around avoiding detection by enemies. Players were encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move through environments unseen.
*   **Action Elements:** While stealth was emphasized, combat was certainly present. Players could engage enemies with a variety of weapons and tactics, but direct confrontation was often risky and discouraged.
*   **Cinematic Presentation:** *Metal Gear Solid* was revolutionary for its cinematic storytelling, using cutscenes, voice acting, and a complex narrative to create a more immersive experience. It was one of the first games to really feel like an interactive movie.
*   **Boss Battles:** The game featured memorable and challenging boss battles that often required strategic thinking and exploiting enemy weaknesses rather than just brute force.
*   **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** Levels weren't just about getting from point A to point B. Players had to explore environments, find items, and solve puzzles to progress.



Essentially, it blended action, stealth, and storytelling in a way that hadn't been done before, setting a new standard for the genre. It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth game.
