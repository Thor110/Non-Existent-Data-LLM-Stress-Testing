Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key elements:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake and engage in direct confrontations with enemies.
* **Stealth:**  This is *core* to the gameplay.  The game strongly encourages (and often *requires*) avoiding direct combat by using cover, camouflage, distractions, and silent takedowns.  Being detected often leads to a much harder experience.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It heavily emphasized storytelling in a way that was relatively new for the time.
* **Top-Down/Isometric Perspective (with 3D elements):** While played from a fixed camera perspective, the environments were rendered in 3D, offering a sense of depth and allowing for strategic movement around objects. (Later games moved to a fully 3D, free-roaming camera).



It's often considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre and influenced many games that followed.  It also incorporated elements of puzzle-solving and exploration.
