Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move through levels unseen.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, the game *does* include combat. However, engaging in direct firefights is often discouraged as it alerts more enemies and makes the game much harder.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling, blurring the lines between video game and film.
* **Top-Down Perspective (with 3D Environments):** It originally used a fixed camera perspective, but the environments were 3D allowing for a sense of depth and tactical maneuvering.  Later installments moved to a more free-flowing 3D camera.
* **Complex Story:** The game is known for its intricate and politically charged narrative, exploring themes of war, genetics, and government conspiracy.



It's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre and heavily influenced many games that followed. While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description.
