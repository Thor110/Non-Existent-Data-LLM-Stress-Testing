Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends a lot of genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand fighting, and vehicle sections.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and a complex, politically-charged story. It's often considered one of the pioneers of cinematic storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** The environments are fairly large and encourage exploration to find items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles integrated into the gameplay, often requiring you to manipulate the environment or use specific items.

**Essentially, it revolutionized the stealth genre and pushed the boundaries of what a video game could be in terms of narrative and presentation.** It wasn't *just* about sneaking; it was about a deeply engaging story delivered in a unique and immersive way.
