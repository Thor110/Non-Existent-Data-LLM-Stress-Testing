Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really influential one that blended genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth is Core:** The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies. This was *revolutionary* for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  It's just much harder and riskier than staying hidden.  You have weapons, and can engage in gunfights, but you're often at a disadvantage.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling – blurring the lines between video game and film.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** There's a good amount of exploration within the levels, and you often need to solve puzzles to progress.
* **Top-Down Perspective with 3D Environments:** While often described as a "top-down" game, it's more accurate to say it uses a fixed camera perspective within fully 3D environments, allowing for a sense of depth and immersion.

**In short:** It's a pioneering title that established many conventions of the stealth action genre, and is known for its complex story, cinematic presentation, and strategic gameplay.
