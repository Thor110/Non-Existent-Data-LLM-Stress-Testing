Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past guards rather than engaging in direct combat.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, combat *is* possible. Players can use a variety of weapons and engage in firefights, though it's often risky and not the intended primary method of progression.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex storyline, and character development – elements usually reserved for movies. It essentially pioneered the "cinematic action game" genre.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes puzzles that need to be solved to progress, often involving finding items, manipulating the environment, or deciphering codes.
* **Top-Down Perspective with 3D Environments:** While technically a 3D game, much of the gameplay takes place from a top-down, fixed camera perspective. This was a unique approach at the time.

**In essence, it's a blend of action, stealth, puzzle-solving, and a heavy emphasis on narrative, delivered with a cinematic flair.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre and influencing countless games that followed.
