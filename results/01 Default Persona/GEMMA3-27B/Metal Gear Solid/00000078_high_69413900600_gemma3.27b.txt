Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining characteristic. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, combat *is* possible. When unavoidable, players engage in third-person shooting with a variety of weapons.
* **Cinematic Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its complex, politically-charged narrative delivered through lengthy cutscenes and codec conversations. It blurred the lines between video game and film.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game incorporates environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress through areas using their wits.
* **Boss Battles:** Iconic and challenging boss fights are a major part of the experience, often requiring specific strategies beyond just shooting.



While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description. It's often credited with popularizing and refining the stealth genre in video games.
