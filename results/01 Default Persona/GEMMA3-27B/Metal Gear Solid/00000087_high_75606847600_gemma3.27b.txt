Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game and blends several genres together. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), the game features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and complex, politically-driven story. It pioneered cinematic presentation in games.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress by manipulating objects and using items.
* **Boss Battles:**  Each boss is a unique and challenging encounter, often requiring specific tactics and strategies.

While often categorized as just "stealth," it's more accurate to say it's a **cinematic action-stealth game with strong elements of puzzle-solving and storytelling.** It really helped *define* the stealth action genre.
