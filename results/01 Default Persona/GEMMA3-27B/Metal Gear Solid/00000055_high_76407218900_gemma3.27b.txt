Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements of several genres, making it a bit more complex than a simple label. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and becomes necessary at times. It features third-person shooting, melee combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It heavily emphasized narrative and character development, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** Players explore detailed environments, finding items, uncovering secrets, and completing objectives.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements that add another layer to the gameplay.



Essentially, it *defined* the stealth action genre and set a new standard for cinematic storytelling in video games. While you could call it an action game, the emphasis on avoiding conflict is what truly sets it apart.
