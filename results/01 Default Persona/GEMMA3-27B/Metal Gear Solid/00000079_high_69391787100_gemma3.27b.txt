Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible and sometimes necessary. It features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and its complex, politically charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Players explore detailed environments, searching for items and uncovering secrets.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements throughout the game.



Essentially, it pioneered what became known as the "cinematic stealth action" genre.  It wasn't *just* about sneaking; it was about a compelling story delivered in a very dramatic and immersive way.
