Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's also a blend of several genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, close-quarters combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and complex cutscenes, and a focus on narrative that goes far beyond most games of its time. It's often considered a pioneer in cinematic game storytelling.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game incorporates environmental puzzles and requires players to find items and use them strategically.
* **Exploration:**  Players explore detailed environments, searching for items, uncovering secrets, and finding alternative routes.



Essentially, it's a groundbreaking title that popularized the stealth action genre and pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games. It's often credited with being one of the first true "cinematic" games.
