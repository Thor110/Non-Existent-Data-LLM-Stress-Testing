Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to bypass enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  It's just much harder and riskier than avoiding it.  The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, complex characters, and political themes. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** The game features large environments to explore, with secrets and items hidden throughout.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are puzzles to solve, often involving finding codes, manipulating the environment, or using items in specific ways.

**Essentially, it's a hybrid, but it *defined* the modern stealth action genre.**  It's often credited with popularizing the "tactical espionage action" label Hideo Kojima (the creator) used for the series.
