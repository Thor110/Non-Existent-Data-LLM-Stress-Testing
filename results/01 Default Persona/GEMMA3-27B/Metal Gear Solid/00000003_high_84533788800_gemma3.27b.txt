Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more nuanced than just that! Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to sneak past enemies, use cover, and utilize distractions. This was *highly* innovative for its time and really defined the genre.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, combat *is* possible. Players can use weapons, engage in close quarters combat, and utilize various gadgets. It's just often a last resort, or strategically used when stealth fails.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex storyline, and character development. It blurred the lines between video game and movie.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environments to explore and puzzles to solve, adding another layer of gameplay.
* **Fourth Wall Breaks:** Hideo Kojima, the creator, famously incorporated elements that break the fourth wall, directly addressing the player.

**In short:** It's an action game *defined* by its emphasis on stealth, but with a strong narrative, cinematic presentation, and unique gameplay mechanics that set it apart. It's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre.
