Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the key elements:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake and engage in fights with guards and bosses.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining characteristic.  The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to use cover, camouflage, and silent takedowns to progress without being detected.  Being spotted triggers alarms and makes the game much harder.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in its use of long, detailed cutscenes and complex, political storytelling. It's not just about gameplay; it's about a narrative experience.
* **Exploration:**  You explore detailed environments, searching for items, information, and pathways.

While it has elements of other genres (like puzzle-solving), **action stealth** is the most accurate description of Metal Gear Solid. It essentially *popularized* the stealth genre in gaming.
