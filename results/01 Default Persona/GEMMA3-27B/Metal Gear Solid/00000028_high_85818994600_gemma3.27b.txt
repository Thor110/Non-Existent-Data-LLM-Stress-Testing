Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's much more than *just* that. It pioneered and heavily popularized the stealth action genre, but it also incorporates elements of:

* **Action:** There's plenty of combat, though the game encourages avoiding it.
* **Adventure:**  It features a complex story, exploration, and puzzle-solving.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes:**  Metal Gear Solid is famous for its long, elaborate cutscenes that drive the narrative.
* **Survival Horror:**  Early on, the feeling of being outnumbered and needing to avoid detection created a tense, horror-like atmosphere.

**Key characteristics that define it as a stealth game:**

* **Emphasis on avoiding direct confrontation:** Players are encouraged to sneak past enemies rather than engage in open combat.
* **Use of cover and camouflage:**  Hiding in shadows, behind objects, and using disguises are crucial to success.
* **Enemy awareness and patrol patterns:**  Understanding how enemies move and react is essential for planning routes and avoiding detection.
* **Non-lethal options:** Players can often subdue enemies without killing them.



While it has action elements, the core gameplay revolves around *not* being seen and strategically maneuvering through environments. This is what sets it apart and makes it a defining title in the stealth genre.
