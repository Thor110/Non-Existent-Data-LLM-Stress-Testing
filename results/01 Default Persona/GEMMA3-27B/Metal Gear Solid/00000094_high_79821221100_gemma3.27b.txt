Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation and use cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is definitely present. When stealth fails or is strategically bypassed, players engage in third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  *Metal Gear Solid* was revolutionary for its incredibly detailed story, delivered through long, movie-like cutscenes. It pushed the boundaries of narrative in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game incorporates environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, the game had a feeling of vulnerability and limited resources, borrowing some elements from the survival horror genre.

**In short, it's an action stealth game with a heavy emphasis on cinematic storytelling, puzzle-solving, and a touch of survival horror.**  It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre.
