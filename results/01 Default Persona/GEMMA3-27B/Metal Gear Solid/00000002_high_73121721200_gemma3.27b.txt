Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining feature. Players are strongly encouraged (and often required) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  When unavoidable, players engage in third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid pioneered a level of cinematic storytelling rarely seen in games at the time.  Long, detailed cutscenes were integral to the experience.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game also features environmental puzzles and challenges that need to be overcome to progress.
* **Boss Battles:** Iconic and challenging boss fights are a major part of the game.



It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre and influencing countless games that followed.  It's not *just* an action game, nor *just* a stealth game - the blend of both, combined with its narrative focus, is what makes it special.
