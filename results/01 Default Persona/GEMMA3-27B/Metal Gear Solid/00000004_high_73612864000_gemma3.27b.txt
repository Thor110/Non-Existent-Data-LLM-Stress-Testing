Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very complex game that blends several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  The game features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, complex plot, and character development. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements that require players to think strategically.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, resources are limited, and enemies are tough, creating a sense of vulnerability reminiscent of survival horror.

**Essentially, it's a pioneering title that established the modern stealth action genre.** It wasn't *just* about shooting; it was about *how* you approached situations and the narrative experience.
