Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are heavily encouraged (and often *need* to) avoid direct confrontation with enemies.  Hiding in shadows, using cover, distracting guards, and careful movement are crucial.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of various gadgets. However, going in guns blazing is usually a recipe for disaster.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** Players explore detailed environments, uncovering secrets and finding items.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements woven into the gameplay.



It's often credited with popularizing (or even *defining*) the stealth action genre.  While other games had stealth elements before, Metal Gear Solid refined and perfected them, creating a truly immersive and strategic experience.
