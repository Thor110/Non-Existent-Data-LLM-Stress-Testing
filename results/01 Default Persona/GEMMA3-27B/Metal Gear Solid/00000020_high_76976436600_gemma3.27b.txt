Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the genres it blends:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is definitely present. When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), the game features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its long, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. This pushed it into the realm of **cinematic games** and helped establish the idea of video games as a storytelling medium.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, the game had elements of resource management (limited ammo, rations) and a sense of vulnerability that borrowed from the survival horror genre.

**In short, it's best described as an action-stealth game with strong cinematic and narrative elements.** It's considered a pioneer of the stealth genre and had a huge impact on game design.
