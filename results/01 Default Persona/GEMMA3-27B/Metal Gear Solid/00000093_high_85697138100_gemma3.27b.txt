Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, combat *is* possible.  It's often difficult, but players can engage in gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and use various weapons.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in terms of its lengthy, complex, and cinematic story delivered through beautifully produced cutscenes. It's often described as a cinematic experience *within* a game.
* **Exploration:** The environments are fairly large and detailed, encouraging players to explore and find items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles integrated into the gameplay, often requiring players to figure out codes, manipulate the environment, or use items in specific ways.



Essentially, it pioneered a new style of gameplay that emphasized tactical thinking, avoiding conflict, and a deep, engaging narrative. It's considered a landmark title in video game history for its influence on the stealth genre and its storytelling approach.
