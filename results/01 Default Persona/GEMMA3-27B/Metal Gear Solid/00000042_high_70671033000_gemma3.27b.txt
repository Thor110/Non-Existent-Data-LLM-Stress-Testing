Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really important game because it *helped define* the stealth action genre. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. Players can engage enemies with weapons, but direct confrontation is often risky and discouraged.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and voice acting - all relatively uncommon in games at the time.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game features environmental puzzles and challenges that players must overcome to progress.
* **Boss Battles:**  Iconic and memorable boss battles are a key component, often requiring strategic thinking and unique approaches.



While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description. It's often credited with popularizing the concept of a truly immersive stealth experience in gaming.
