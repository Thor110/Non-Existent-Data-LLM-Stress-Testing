Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and it blends elements of several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, close-quarters combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid pioneered long, detailed cutscenes and a complex, political storyline. This pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games at the time. It's often described as a "cinematic experience."
* **Exploration:** The game features interconnected environments to explore, with secrets and items to find.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are puzzles integrated into the gameplay, often requiring players to use their wits and the environment to progress.



Essentially, it's a game where you *can* fight, but you're much more effective if you avoid it and use strategy and cunning. It's considered a hugely influential title in the stealth genre, and a landmark game for its narrative and presentation.
