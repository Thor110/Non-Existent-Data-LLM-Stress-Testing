Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key characteristics within the game:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies. Getting spotted often leads to difficult fights, making stealth the preferred method of progression.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, *Metal Gear Solid* isn't *just* about hiding.  There's plenty of action in the form of gun combat, hand-to-hand fighting (CQC - Close Quarters Combat), and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** *Metal Gear Solid* was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and character development – elements rarely seen in games at the time. It blurred the line between game and movie.
* **Top-Down/Isometric Perspective with 3D Models:** While played from a fixed camera perspective, the environments and characters were rendered in 3D, a relative novelty for the time.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game features puzzles and challenges that need to be solved to progress, often requiring the player to use their surroundings and items strategically.



It's often considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre, heavily influencing many games that followed.  While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description.
