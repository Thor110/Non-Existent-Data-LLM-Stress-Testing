Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key characteristics:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and movement-based gameplay. You control Solid Snake and engage in firefights with enemies.
* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the game.  Metal Gear Solid revolutionized stealth gameplay.  It heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation by using cover, camouflage, distraction, and careful movement.  You're encouraged to sneak past enemies rather than fight them.  Being detected often leads to difficult encounters.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is known for its long, detailed cutscenes and a complex, political storyline. It wasn't just about gameplay; it was about *experiencing* a narrative.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements throughout the game.
* **Boss Battles:**  Iconic and challenging boss battles are a significant part of the experience.



While it has action elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter. The game *rewards* strategic, stealthy play above all else.  It's often considered a pioneer of the stealth genre.
