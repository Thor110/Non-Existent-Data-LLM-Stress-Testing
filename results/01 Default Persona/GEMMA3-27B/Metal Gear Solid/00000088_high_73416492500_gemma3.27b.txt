Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key features:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and navigating environments. You directly control Solid Snake and engage in physical confrontations with enemies.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining element. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct combat.  You're encouraged to sneak past enemies, use cover, distract them, and incapacitate them non-lethally.  Being detected often leads to difficult fights, so remaining unseen is crucial.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, cinematic cutscenes and complex, politically-charged story. This pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Tactical Espionage Action (as Hideo Kojima famously called it):**  This phrase encapsulates the blend of action, stealth, and strategic planning the game requires.

While it has action elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter. Success in Metal Gear Solid relies far more on planning, patience, and skillful use of stealth tactics.
