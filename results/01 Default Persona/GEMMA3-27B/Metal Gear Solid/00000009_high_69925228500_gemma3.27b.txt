Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining feature. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.  It pioneered many stealth mechanics still used today.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  Solid Snake can engage enemies with weapons, though it's often risky and less effective than avoiding them.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex story delivered through cinematic cutscenes. It's more than just gameplay; it's a narrative experience.
* **Exploration:** Players explore detailed environments, finding items and uncovering secrets.
* **Boss Battles:**  The game features memorable and challenging boss fights that often require unique strategies.

While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" best encapsulates what Metal Gear Solid is all about. It's often credited with popularizing the stealth genre in video games.
