Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the elements that define it:

* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation with enemies.  Hiding in shadows, using cover, distracting guards, and silent takedowns are crucial for success.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, the game isn't *just* about avoiding enemies. There's plenty of combat, including shooting, using grenades, and engaging in hand-to-hand fights. However, running in guns blazing is usually a recipe for disaster.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its time in its use of cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and a complex, story-driven narrative. It heavily influenced the "cinematic action game" genre.
* **Exploration:** The game involves exploring detailed environments, finding items, and uncovering secrets.
* **Boss Battles:**  Memorable and challenging boss battles are a key feature, often requiring strategic thinking and exploiting weaknesses.



While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description.  It essentially *defined* the modern stealth action genre, paving the way for games like Splinter Cell and Splinter Cell.
