Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key characteristics:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake and engage in direct confrontations with enemies.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining characteristic. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding detection. You're encouraged to sneak past enemies, use cover, distract them, and utilize non-lethal takedowns.  Being discovered often leads to difficult fights, so stealth is the preferred method of progression.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is a phrase Hideo Kojima (the creator) used to describe the gameplay, highlighting the strategic element of planning and executing missions.

While it has action elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter. The core gameplay loop revolves around careful planning, observation, and avoiding conflict whenever possible.
