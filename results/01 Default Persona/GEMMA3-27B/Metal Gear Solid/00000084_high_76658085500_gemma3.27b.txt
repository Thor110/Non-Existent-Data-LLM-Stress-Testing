Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game and incorporates elements of several other genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or isn't desired), the game features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games at the time. It's more like an interactive movie than many games of its era.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress through levels.
* **Survival Horror elements:** While not a pure horror game, it incorporates elements like limited resources (ammunition, health) and a tense atmosphere.



Essentially, it *defined* the modern stealth action genre, and is considered a landmark title for its innovative gameplay, storytelling, and cinematic presentation.
