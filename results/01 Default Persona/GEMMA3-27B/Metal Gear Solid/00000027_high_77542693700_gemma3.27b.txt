Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the elements that defined it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolved around avoiding direct confrontation. Players were encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies rather than engaging in gunfights. This was *revolutionary* for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth was key, combat was still present. Players could fight enemies, but doing so often alerted others and made the game significantly harder.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex narrative – blurring the lines between video game and film.
* **Top-Down Perspective (with 3D environments):** It initially used a fixed camera perspective, but the environments were fully 3D, allowing for depth and strategic movement.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game included puzzles and challenges that required players to think strategically and utilize their environment.

**It's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre** and heavily influenced countless games that followed.  While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description.
