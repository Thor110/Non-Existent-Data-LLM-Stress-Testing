Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really groundbreaking one that blended several genres together! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features third-person shooting, melee attacks, and a variety of weapons.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It heavily focused on narrative and character development, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed with multiple paths and secrets to discover.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  Players often need to solve environmental puzzles to progress.



Essentially, it was a pioneering title that helped define the stealth action genre and demonstrated the potential for video games to deliver complex, movie-like narratives. It's often credited with popularizing the "cinematic experience" in gaming.
