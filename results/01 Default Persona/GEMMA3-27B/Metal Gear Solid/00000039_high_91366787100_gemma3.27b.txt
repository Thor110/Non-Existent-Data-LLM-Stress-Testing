Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and it pioneered many elements that define the genre today. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move undetected.  Being seen often leads to difficult combat encounters.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is paramount, combat *is* possible. Players can use a variety of weapons and engage in firefights, but it's usually more advantageous to avoid them.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** *Metal Gear Solid* was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling – it felt more like an interactive movie than most games of its time.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game features puzzles and environmental challenges that need to be solved to progress.
* **Boss Battles:** Iconic and challenging boss battles are a major component, often requiring specific strategies and exploiting weaknesses.
* **Fourth Wall Breaks:** Hideo Kojima, the creator, loved to break the fourth wall, with characters directly addressing the player and acknowledging the game's nature.



Essentially, it's a blend of these elements, but **stealth is the defining characteristic** that sets it apart. It's considered a hugely influential game that helped establish the modern stealth genre.
