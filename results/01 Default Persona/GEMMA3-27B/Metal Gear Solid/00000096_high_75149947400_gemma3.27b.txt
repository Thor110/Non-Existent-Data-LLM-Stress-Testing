Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's a bit more nuanced than *just* that. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and silent takedowns.  It popularized the modern stealth genre.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is prioritized, combat *is* possible. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though it's often a last resort.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex storyline, blurring the lines between video game and film.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features levels that need to be explored to find items, uncover secrets, and solve puzzles to progress.
* **Boss Battles:** Memorable and challenging boss fights are a key component.

**In short, it's an action game where stealth is the *primary* method of success, elevated by a strong narrative and cinematic presentation.** It's often credited with defining the stealth action genre.
