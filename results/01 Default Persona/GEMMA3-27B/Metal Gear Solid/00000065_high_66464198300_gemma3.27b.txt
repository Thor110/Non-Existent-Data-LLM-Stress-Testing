Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is certainly present.  When stealth fails (or when the player chooses), they can engage in gunfights and hand-to-hand combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in its use of lengthy, detailed cutscenes and a complex, political storyline. It blended gameplay with a movie-like narrative.
* **Exploration:** The game features environments to explore, with secrets and items to find.
* **Boss Battles:** Memorable and challenging boss fights are a staple of the series.

While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate description. It's often credited with popularizing the stealth genre in video games.
