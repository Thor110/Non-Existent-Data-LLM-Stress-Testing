Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and its complex, politically-charged narrative. This pushes it beyond a simple action game and into a more cinematic experience.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game includes environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.

**Essentially, it pioneered the "cinematic stealth action" genre.**  It wasn't *just* about sneaking; it was about a compelling story delivered in a way that was revolutionary for its time.
