Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. You're encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past guards rather than engage in direct combat.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is prioritized, combat *is* possible.  You have weapons and can fight, but it's generally more difficult and risky than staying hidden.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex narrative, and character development.  It heavily borrowed from film techniques.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  Levels aren't just about sneaking; you often need to explore to find items, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets.
* **Boss Battles:**  Iconic and challenging boss battles are a key part of the experience. These often require strategy and exploiting weaknesses rather than just brute force.



Essentially, it pioneered a subgenre within action games, becoming a defining title for the "stealth action" genre. It's more than *just* stealth though - it's a rich, story-driven experience.
