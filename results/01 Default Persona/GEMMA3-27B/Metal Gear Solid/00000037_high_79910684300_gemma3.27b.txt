Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key elements:

* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is paramount, combat *is* possible.  However, going in guns blazing is usually a difficult and risky strategy.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in its use of long, detailed cutscenes and a complex, politically-charged narrative.  It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is the subtitle of the original game and a good descriptor of the overall feel.  You're not just running and gunning; you're planning, observing, and utilizing tools to achieve objectives.
* **Exploration:** The game features fairly large environments to explore, encouraging players to find alternate routes and hidden items.



While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate and defining description. It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth game genre.
