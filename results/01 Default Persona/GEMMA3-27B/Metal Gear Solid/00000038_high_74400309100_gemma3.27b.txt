Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move through levels undetected.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is prioritized, combat *is* possible. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though doing so often attracts more attention.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex story, blurring the lines between games and movies.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are relatively large and encourage exploration to find items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are often puzzles and challenges that need to be solved to progress.

**It's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre**, and heavily influenced many games that followed.  While it has elements of other genres, its defining characteristic is the emphasis on *tactical espionage action* - completing missions using stealth and strategy over brute force.
