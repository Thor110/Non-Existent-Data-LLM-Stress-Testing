Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and it blends several genres together. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. Players can use a variety of weapons and engage in firefights, though it's generally more difficult and risky than remaining hidden.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It heavily emphasized a deep, political, and philosophical story - far beyond what was typical for games at the time.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are often puzzles to solve, requiring players to figure out how to progress or access certain areas.

**In short, it's a pioneering title that really established the modern stealth action genre, but it's also known for its narrative depth and cinematic presentation.** It's often considered a foundational game in the development of cinematic gaming.
