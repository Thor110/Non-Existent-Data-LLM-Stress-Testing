Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and silent takedowns. It wasn't the *first* stealth game, but it revolutionized the genre and popularized many of its conventions.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is central, the game also includes combat.  Players can engage enemies with weapons, but doing so often alerts more enemies and makes stealth harder.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and voice acting – blurring the lines between video game and movie.
* **Exploration:**  Players explore detailed environments, uncovering secrets and items.
* **Boss Battles:** The game features memorable and challenging boss battles that often require strategic thinking and unique approaches.

While it has elements of other genres, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining description of Metal Gear Solid. It's considered a pioneer and a hugely influential title in the genre.
