Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, combat *is* possible. It's just much harder and riskier than avoiding it. There's shooting, hand-to-hand combat, and vehicle sections.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, movie-style cutscenes and complex, philosophical narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** The environments are fairly expansive and encourage exploration to find items, unlock secrets, and discover alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are puzzles integrated into the gameplay, often requiring players to find items or manipulate the environment to progress.



Essentially, it was a revolutionary title that established many of the tropes we see in modern stealth-action games. It wasn't *just* stealth, but that was the defining mechanic and the way the game was designed to be played.
