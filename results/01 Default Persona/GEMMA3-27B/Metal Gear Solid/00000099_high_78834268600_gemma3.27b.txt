Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move undetected.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  However, going in guns blazing is often difficult and not the intended way to play.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling – pushing the boundaries of what was expected in video games at the time.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is the series' self-proclaimed genre. It highlights the blend of stealth, action, and strategic thinking.
* **Top-Down/Fixed Camera Angles:** The original Metal Gear Solid used fixed camera angles, which added to the tension and required players to carefully plan their movements. (Later installments moved to more dynamic camera systems.)



While it has elements of other genres, like adventure and puzzle-solving, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining description. It essentially *popularized* the stealth genre as we know it today.
