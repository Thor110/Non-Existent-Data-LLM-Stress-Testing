Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation and use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), it features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** *Metal Gear Solid* is famous for its long, elaborate cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It heavily influenced the trend of cinematic storytelling in games.
* **Exploration:** While linear in many ways, there's still exploration involved in finding items, uncovering secrets, and completing optional objectives.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game includes puzzles, often requiring you to find codes, manipulate the environment, or use specific items.

Essentially, it pioneered a new style of gameplay, emphasizing tactical thinking and a narrative-driven experience over purely run-and-gun action. It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre.
