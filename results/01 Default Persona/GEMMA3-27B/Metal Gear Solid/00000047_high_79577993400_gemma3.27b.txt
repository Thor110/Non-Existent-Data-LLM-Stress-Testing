Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's also heavily influenced by and incorporates elements of several other genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, utilizing cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is prioritized, combat *is* possible and sometimes necessary. It's a third-person shooter with a focus on tactical engagements.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in its use of lengthy, detailed cutscenes and a complex, politically-charged narrative.  It pioneered cinematic presentation in games.
* **Exploration:** The environments are fairly large and encourage exploration for items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are puzzles integrated into the level design, often requiring players to find codes, manipulate objects, or use items in creative ways.



Essentially, it *defined* the stealth action genre, but it's more than just one thing.  It's a blend of all those elements that made it so influential and critically acclaimed.
