Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really influential and complex one that blends several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation and use cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. Players can engage enemies with weapons, but it's often risky and not the intended playstyle.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative.  It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and challenges that need to be overcome to progress.



It's often considered a foundational title for the **stealth action genre**, and it's known for its innovative gameplay mechanics, compelling story, and memorable characters.
