Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and silent takedowns.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is definitely present. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though it's often risky.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and storytelling – pushing the boundaries of what was expected in video games at the time.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** The game features environments to explore and puzzles to solve, often integrated with the stealth and action.
* **Fourth Wall Breaks:**  A unique feature is the game's tendency to break the fourth wall, with characters acknowledging the player and the fact they're in a game.



Essentially, it pioneered a genre and blended several elements together in a way that hadn't been done before, making it incredibly influential.  It's often considered a foundational title for the modern stealth action genre.
