Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies. This was a *huge* innovation for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is key, combat *is* possible. Players can use weapons and engage in firefights, but it's generally more difficult and less effective than remaining undetected.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and voice acting – bringing a level of narrative depth rarely seen in games at the time.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** The game involves exploring environments, finding items, and solving puzzles to progress.
* **Top-Down Perspective with 3D Environments:** It used a fixed camera perspective, but the environments were fully 3D, which was relatively new for console games in 1998.



While it has elements of other genres, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining description.  It essentially *popularized* the stealth genre as we know it today.
