Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very complex game that blends several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, melee combat, and a variety of weapons.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games at the time.  It's more like an interactive movie than many games of its era.
* **Exploration:**  The environments are relatively large and encourage exploration for items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles to overcome, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.



Essentially, it *defined* the stealth action genre and was a huge influence on games that followed. It wasn't *just* an action game, and it wasn't *just* a stealth game – it was a unique combination that prioritized strategic thinking and narrative depth.
