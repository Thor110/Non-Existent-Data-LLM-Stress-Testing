Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a very influential title that blended several genres together, making it hard to pin down with just one label. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat *is* possible and present. The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its cinematic presentation, lengthy cutscenes, and complex, politically-charged story. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Players explore detailed environments, finding items, uncovering secrets, and completing objectives.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles throughout the game, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.

**Essentially, it's a pioneering title that established the modern stealth action genre.**  It's often credited with popularizing the idea of a game focused on avoiding enemies rather than simply shooting everything in sight.
