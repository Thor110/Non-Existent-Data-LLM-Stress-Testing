Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements from several genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to bypass enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of various weapons and equipment.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It heavily emphasized storytelling and character development, almost like an interactive movie.
* **Exploration:** The environments, while linear in progression, offer areas to explore for items, secrets, and strategic advantages.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes some environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress through certain areas.

**Essentially, it pioneered the "cinematic stealth action" genre.**  It wasn't *just* about sneaking around; it was about a compelling story told through immersive gameplay and dramatic presentation.
