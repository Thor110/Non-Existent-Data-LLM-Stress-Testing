Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements of several genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to bypass enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat is definitely present. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though doing so often alerts others and makes the game harder.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It leaned heavily into cinematic presentation, more so than most games of its time.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed with multiple paths and secrets to discover, encouraging exploration.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements throughout the game.

**In short, it's a stealth-action game with a strong emphasis on story, cinematic presentation, and strategic gameplay.** It's considered a pioneer of the stealth genre and heavily influenced many games that followed.
