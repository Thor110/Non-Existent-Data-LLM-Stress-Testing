Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a complex game that blends several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and becomes necessary at times. It features third-person shooting with a variety of weapons.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is renowned for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, complex plot, and character development. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game includes environmental puzzles and requires players to figure out how to progress, often involving finding items or manipulating the environment.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, the feeling of being vulnerable and hunted, the limited resources, and the oppressive atmosphere borrow from the survival horror genre.



Essentially, it's a pioneering title that established the modern stealth action genre, but it's much more than *just* a stealth game due to its narrative depth and diverse gameplay elements.
