Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements of several genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features gunplay, hand-to-hand combat, and boss battles. However, running and gunning is generally a poor strategy.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged story. It pushed the boundaries of narrative in video games.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternative routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  Players often need to solve environmental puzzles to progress.

**In short, it's best described as an action-stealth game with strong cinematic and narrative elements.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth genre and influencing many games that followed.
