Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Action Elements:** While stealth is prioritized, the game *does* feature action-packed combat sequences.  You can engage enemies with weapons, but it's usually more difficult and risky than avoiding them.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex storyline, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:** The game involves exploring environments, finding items, and solving puzzles to progress.
* **Top-Down Perspective with 3D Environments:** It utilized a fixed camera perspective within 3D environments, which was innovative for its time.

While it has elements of other genres, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining description of Metal Gear Solid. It essentially *popularized* the stealth action genre, influencing countless games that followed.
