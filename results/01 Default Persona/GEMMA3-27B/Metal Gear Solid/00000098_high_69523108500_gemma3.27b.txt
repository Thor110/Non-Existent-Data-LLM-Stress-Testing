Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key features:

* **Action:** It involves combat, exploration, and completing objectives. You control Solid Snake, and there's plenty of shooting, close-quarters combat, and navigating environments.
* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the gameplay.  The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. You're encouraged to use cover, camouflage, distractions, and silent takedowns to avoid being detected by enemies. Being spotted often leads to a difficult fight, so stealth is the preferred method of progression.

However, it's also considered a pioneer in **cinematic gameplay** and incorporates elements of:

* **Adventure:** There's a strong narrative focus with a complex plot, characters, and cutscenes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** You often need to solve puzzles to progress, like finding codes, manipulating environments, or figuring out enemy patterns.



It's a landmark title that really defined and popularized the stealth action genre.
