Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game and blends elements of several genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  The game features shooting, melee attacks, and a variety of weapons.  However, going in guns blazing is often a quick path to failure.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in its use of lengthy, detailed cutscenes and a complex, political story. It's more like an interactive movie than many games of its era.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed with multiple paths and secrets to discover, encouraging exploration.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements woven into the gameplay.



Essentially, it's a game where you *can* fight, but you're much more effective if you don't.  It pioneered the modern stealth action genre and is considered hugely influential.
