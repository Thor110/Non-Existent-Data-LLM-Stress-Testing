Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key elements:

* **Action:** It involves combat, exploration, and completing objectives. You directly control Solid Snake and engage in firefights (though often discouraged!).
* **Stealth:** This is *the* core of the game.  The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. You're encouraged to use cover, camouflage, distractions, and close-quarters takedowns to bypass enemies undetected.  Being spotted raises the alarm, bringing in reinforcements and making things much harder.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in delivering a complex, politically-charged narrative through lengthy, cinematic cutscenes. It's not just about gameplay; it's about the *story*.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is a phrase often used to describe the series, highlighting the blend of action, stealth, and strategic thinking.

While it has elements of other genres (like puzzle-solving and even a bit of survival horror due to the psychological aspects), **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining categorization.  It essentially *popularized* the modern stealth game genre.
