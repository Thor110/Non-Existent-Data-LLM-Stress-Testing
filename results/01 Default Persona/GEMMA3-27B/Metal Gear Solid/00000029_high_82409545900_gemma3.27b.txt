Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really influential and complex one, blending elements of several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct combat, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and becomes necessary in certain situations. It features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed, and often philosophical cutscenes. It heavily emphasized narrative and character development, moving beyond simple "save the princess" plots.
* **Survival Horror elements:** Early on, resources are limited (ammo, rations, etc.), and enemies can be quite tough, creating a sense of tension and vulnerability similar to survival horror games.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes environmental puzzles and code breaking to progress.

**Essentially, it pioneered the "cinematic stealth action" genre.** It wasn't *just* about sneaking; it was about *how* you snuck, the story behind why you were sneaking, and the dramatic presentation of it all.
