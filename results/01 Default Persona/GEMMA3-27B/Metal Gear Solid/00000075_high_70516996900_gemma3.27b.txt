Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and blends several genres together! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), it features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is *famous* for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games at the time. It's more like an interactive movie in many ways.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game includes environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements that you need to solve to progress.
* **Boss Battles:** Epic and often unconventional boss fights that require strategy and exploiting weaknesses.

**It's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre**, and many games that followed borrowed heavily from its mechanics and presentation.
