Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and incorporates elements of several other genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *need*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and often necessary.  It's not a pure run-and-gun shooter, though - it's more tactical.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in how it presented a complex, politically charged story through long, movie-style cutscenes. This pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:** Levels are designed with multiple paths and secrets to discover.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles integrated into the environment and gameplay, requiring players to think strategically.

**Essentially, it's a blend of these elements, but the emphasis on stealth and the cinematic presentation are what truly defined it and made it a landmark title.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre.
