Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distractions to move undetected. This was *highly* innovative for its time.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible.  Players can use a variety of weapons and engage in gunfights, though doing so often alerts more enemies.
* **Cinematic Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its complex, lengthy, and cinematic cutscenes. It pioneered a level of storytelling rarely seen in games at the time.
* **Exploration:** The game features interconnected environments to explore, with secrets and items to discover.
* **Boss Battles:** Memorable and challenging boss battles are a key component, often requiring strategic thinking and specific tactics.
* **Fourth Wall Breaks:** Hideo Kojima, the creator, frequently broke the fourth wall, with characters directly addressing the player and acknowledging the game's nature.



While you could classify it as an action game, the *emphasis* on stealth and the innovative ways it implemented it are what really define Metal Gear Solid and cemented its place in gaming history.  It essentially *created* the modern stealth action genre.
