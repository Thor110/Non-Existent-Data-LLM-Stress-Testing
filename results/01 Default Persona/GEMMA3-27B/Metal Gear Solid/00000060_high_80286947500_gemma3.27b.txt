Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the elements that define it:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation with enemies. You do this by hiding in shadows, using camouflage, distracting guards, and moving silently.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, combat *is* present. When stealth fails or isn't feasible, players can engage in gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and use various weapons and gadgets.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its time in how it delivered a complex, politically-charged narrative through long, detailed cutscenes. It blurred the lines between video game and film.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Boss Battles:** Memorable and challenging boss encounters are a signature feature of the series.

While it has elements of other genres, like adventure and puzzle-solving, **action stealth** is the most accurate and defining classification for Metal Gear Solid.  It essentially *popularized* the modern stealth genre.
