Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.  While combat *is* possible, it's often risky and less effective than staying hidden.
* **Action Elements:**  When stealth fails (or is intentionally bypassed), the game features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and character development - pushing the boundaries of what was expected in video games at the time.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game includes puzzles and environmental challenges that need to be overcome to progress.
* **Boss Battles:**  Epic and memorable boss battles against uniquely designed characters.



While it has action components, it's the emphasis on *avoiding* confrontation that truly defines Metal Gear Solid and cemented its place as a pioneer in the stealth genre.  It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth game.
