Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and blends several genres together. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat is definitely present. Players can engage enemies with weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and various gadgets.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  The game features interconnected environments that players explore to find items, complete objectives, and uncover secrets.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles integrated into the gameplay, requiring players to think strategically to progress.

**Essentially, it pioneered what's now often called the "cinematic stealth action" genre.** It wasn't *just* about sneaking; it was about a deeply involved story delivered in a way that felt like an interactive movie.
