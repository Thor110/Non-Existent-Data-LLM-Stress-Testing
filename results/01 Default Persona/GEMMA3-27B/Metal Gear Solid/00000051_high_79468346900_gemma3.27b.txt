Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the key elements that define it:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake, and engage in firefights with enemies.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* defining element. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding direct confrontation. You're encouraged (and often *need* to) sneak past enemies, hide in shadows, use camouflage, and utilize distractions.  Getting caught often leads to a difficult fight or even game over.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in terms of storytelling and presentation. It used cinematic camera angles, long cutscenes, and voice acting to create a compelling narrative.
* **Tactical Espionage Action (as Hideo Kojima famously called it):** This encompasses the combination of action, stealth, and strategic thinking required to succeed. You need to analyze enemy patterns, use items strategically, and plan your approach.

While it has elements of other genres (like puzzle-solving), its core gameplay loop revolves around stealth and tactical action, making it a landmark title in the action-stealth genre.
