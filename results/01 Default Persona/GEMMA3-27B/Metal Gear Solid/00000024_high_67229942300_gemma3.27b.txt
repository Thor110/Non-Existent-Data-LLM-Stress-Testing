Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and the key elements:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and physical challenges. You control Solid Snake and engage in firefights, though direct confrontation is often discouraged.
* **Stealth:** This is *the* core mechanic. The game heavily emphasizes avoiding detection by enemies. You use cover, camouflage, distractions, and careful movement to sneak past guards, cameras, and other security measures.  Being spotted often leads to difficult fights, so stealth is the preferred approach.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games, focusing on political intrigue, espionage, and philosophical themes.

While it has action elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter.  The game rewards strategic thinking, planning, and patience.  It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth action genre.
