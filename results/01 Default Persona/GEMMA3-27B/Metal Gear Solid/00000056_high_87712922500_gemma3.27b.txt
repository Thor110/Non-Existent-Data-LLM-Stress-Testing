Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game and blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat *is* possible and often necessary. It features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, complex narrative, and character development. It pioneered cinematic storytelling in video games.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  The game incorporates puzzles, often requiring players to find items, decipher codes, or manipulate the environment.
* **Exploration:** While linear in many ways, there's a degree of exploration within each area to find items and secrets.



It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre and is considered a landmark title in video game history.  It's not *just* an action game because the emphasis on avoiding conflict is so strong, and it's not *just* a stealth game because you can fight when needed. It's the combination, and the way those elements are presented, that makes it special.
