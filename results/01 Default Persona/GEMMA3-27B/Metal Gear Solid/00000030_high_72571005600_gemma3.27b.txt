Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game, and blends several genres together. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *need*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), it features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and a complex, politically-charged narrative. It was a pioneer in bringing cinematic storytelling to video games.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code breaking elements throughout the game.

While categorized as action stealth, it really pushed the boundaries of what that meant and heavily influenced many games that followed. It's often considered a foundational title for the stealth genre.
