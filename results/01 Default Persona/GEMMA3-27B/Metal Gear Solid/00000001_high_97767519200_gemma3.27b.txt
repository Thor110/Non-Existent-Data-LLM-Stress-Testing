Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements from several genres, making it a bit more complex than a simple label. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are heavily encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is favored, combat *is* possible and becomes necessary at times. It features third-person shooting and melee combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid pioneered a level of cinematic presentation and complex narrative in video games, with long, detailed cutscenes and a focus on political intrigue.  This is a big part of what set it apart.
* **Exploration:** The game features interconnected environments to explore, with secrets and items to discover.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and challenges to overcome, often involving finding keycards, manipulating systems, or using items in creative ways.



So, while "action stealth" is the most accurate description, it's often considered a pioneer of the **cinematic action-adventure** genre due to its emphasis on storytelling and presentation.
