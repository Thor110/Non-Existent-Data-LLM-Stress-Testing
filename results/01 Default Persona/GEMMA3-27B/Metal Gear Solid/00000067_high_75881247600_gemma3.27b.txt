Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends several genres together, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are heavily encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distractions to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat is definitely present. Players can engage enemies with weapons, though doing so often attracts more attention.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its time in how it told its story. It featured lengthy, detailed cutscenes, voice acting, and a complex narrative – pushing the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Players explore detailed environments, finding items, uncovering secrets, and progressing through the levels.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are often environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements that need to be solved to advance.

**In short, it's a genre-bending title, but "action stealth" is the most accurate description.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre and influencing countless games that followed.
