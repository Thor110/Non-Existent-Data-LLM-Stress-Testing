Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex one that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** When stealth fails (or you choose to engage), the game features third-person shooting and close-quarters combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** *Metal Gear Solid* revolutionized gaming with its incredibly long, detailed, and often philosophical cutscenes. It's heavily story-driven.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements throughout the game.
* **Exploration:** While linear in many ways, the environments offer areas to explore for items and secrets.

**In essence, it's a third-person action game where stealth is the *preferred* method of progression, but with a strong emphasis on narrative and complex mechanics.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth action genre and setting a new standard for cinematic storytelling in video games.
