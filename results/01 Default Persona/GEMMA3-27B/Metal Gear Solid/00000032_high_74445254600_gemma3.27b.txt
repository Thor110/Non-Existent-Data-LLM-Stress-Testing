Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements that define it:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection by enemies. Players are encouraged to use cover, camouflage, and distraction to move through levels unseen.  While combat *is* possible, it's often a last resort and significantly harder than avoiding it.
* **Action Elements:**  Despite the emphasis on stealth, Metal Gear Solid *does* include action sequences – gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and boss battles.
* **Cinematic Presentation:** It was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, complex story, and character development, blurring the lines between video game and film.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is the official genre Hideo Kojima (the creator) used to describe the series. It emphasizes strategic thinking, planning, and utilizing tools and gadgets.

While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" or "tactical espionage action" best encapsulates what Metal Gear Solid is all about. It's considered a pioneer and hugely influential in the stealth genre.
