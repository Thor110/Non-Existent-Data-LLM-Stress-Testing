Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really groundbreaking example of the genre and incorporates elements of several others. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of various weapons and equipment.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its incredibly detailed story, delivered through lengthy, movie-style cutscenes. This pushed the boundaries of narrative in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:** Players often need to solve environmental puzzles to progress.

**It's often credited with popularizing and solidifying the modern stealth action genre.**  Before Metal Gear Solid, stealth games existed, but it raised the bar for complexity, storytelling, and cinematic presentation.
