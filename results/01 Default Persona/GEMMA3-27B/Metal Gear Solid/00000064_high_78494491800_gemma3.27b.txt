Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a bit more complex than just that! Here's a breakdown of the genres it blends:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is key, there's plenty of action when things go wrong or when you choose to engage. This includes gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and vehicle sections.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged story. This pushed it towards a more narrative-driven experience.
* **Exploration:**  The game features interconnected environments to explore, finding items and uncovering secrets.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are often puzzles integrated into the environments or required to progress.



Essentially, it's a game that *defined* the stealth action genre, but it also incorporates elements of other genres to create a unique and immersive experience. It's often credited with popularizing the cinematic approach to video game storytelling.
