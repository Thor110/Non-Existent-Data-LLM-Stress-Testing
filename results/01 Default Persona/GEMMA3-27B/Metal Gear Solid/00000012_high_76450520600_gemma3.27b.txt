Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really *complex* action stealth game that blends a lot of genres. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible. It's challenging, but players can engage enemies with weapons and hand-to-hand combat.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid is famous for its incredibly long and detailed cutscenes, and complex, political storyline. It pushed the boundaries of narrative in video games.
* **Exploration:** The game features fairly large environments to explore, with secrets and items to find.
* **Puzzle Solving:** There are puzzles integrated into the environment and gameplay, requiring players to think strategically.

**Essentially, it's considered a pioneer of the stealth action genre, and heavily influenced subsequent games with its cinematic presentation and narrative depth.**  It's often cited as one of the most important and influential video games of all time.
