Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key characteristics:

* **Stealth Focus:** The core gameplay revolves around avoiding direct confrontation. Players are encouraged to sneak past enemies, use cover, and utilize distractions.  This was *highly* innovative for its time, popularizing the stealth genre.
* **Action Elements:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible. Players can engage enemies with weapons, but doing so often attracts attention and makes things harder.
* **Cinematic Presentation:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic cutscenes, voice acting, and complex narrative, blurring the lines between games and movies.
* **Top-Down Perspective (with 3D environments):**  It originally played from a top-down perspective, but with fully 3D environments, allowing for hiding *behind* objects, a novelty at the time.
* **Puzzle Solving:** The game features puzzles and challenges that require players to think strategically and use the environment to their advantage.



While it has elements of other genres, "action stealth" is the most accurate and defining description of Metal Gear Solid. It's often credited with defining and popularizing the stealth genre as we know it today.
