Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a really complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is preferred, combat *is* possible. The game features third-person shooting, hand-to-hand fighting, and vehicle sections.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its lengthy, complex, and cinematic cutscenes. It prioritized a deep, philosophical story with political themes, far beyond what was typical for the time. This pushes it into narrative-driven adventure game territory.
* **Exploration & Puzzle Solving:**  The game features environments to explore, and you often need to solve puzzles to progress, like finding keycards or manipulating the environment.

**In essence, it's a pioneering example of the stealth action genre, but with strong elements of cinematic storytelling, adventure, and puzzle-solving.** It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth game formula.
