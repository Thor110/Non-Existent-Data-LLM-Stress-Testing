Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it's a complex game that blends several genres! Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the game. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to sneak past enemies.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible.  The game features third-person shooting, and players can engage in firefights, though often at a disadvantage if they've been detected.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was groundbreaking for its cinematic presentation and complex, political storyline. It's often considered a pioneer in narrative-driven gaming.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements that players need to solve to progress.
* **Exploration:** Players explore detailed environments, uncovering secrets and items.



Essentially, it's a blend of all these, but **stealth is the defining element** that sets it apart. It's often credited with popularizing the modern stealth action genre.
