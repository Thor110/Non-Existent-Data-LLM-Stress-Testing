Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. However, it blends elements of several genres, making it quite unique. Here's a breakdown:

* **Stealth:** This is the core of the gameplay. Players are encouraged (and often *required*) to avoid direct confrontation, using cover, camouflage, and distraction to move undetected.
* **Action:** While stealth is emphasized, combat *is* possible and sometimes necessary. It's generally challenging, and encourages tactical thinking.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:** Metal Gear Solid was revolutionary for its lengthy, detailed cutscenes and complex, politically-charged narrative. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Exploration:**  Levels are designed to be explored, with hidden items, secrets, and alternate routes.
* **Puzzle Solving:**  There are environmental puzzles and code-breaking elements throughout the game.

**In essence, it's a pioneering title that established many conventions of the stealth action genre, and is known for its cinematic presentation and intricate plot.** It's often credited with popularizing the stealth genre as we know it today.
