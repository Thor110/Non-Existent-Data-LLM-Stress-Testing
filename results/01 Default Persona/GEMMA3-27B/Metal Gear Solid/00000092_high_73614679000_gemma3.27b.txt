Metal Gear Solid is primarily an **action stealth game**. 

Here's a breakdown of what that means and its key elements:

* **Action:** It features combat, shooting, and movement-based gameplay. You control Solid Snake and engage in firefights, though direct confrontation is often discouraged.
* **Stealth:** This is the *core* of the game.  Metal Gear Solid revolutionized stealth gameplay. You're encouraged to avoid direct combat by hiding in shadows, crawling through vents, using camouflage, and distracting enemies.  Being detected has significant consequences.
* **Cinematic Cutscenes & Storytelling:**  Metal Gear Solid is also known for its incredibly long and complex cinematic cutscenes, and a deep, philosophical story. It pushed the boundaries of storytelling in video games.
* **Tactical Espionage Action:** This is the subtitle of the original game, and accurately reflects the blend of strategic thinking, covert movement, and action.

While it has shooting elements, it's not a run-and-gun shooter.  Success in Metal Gear Solid relies far more on planning, patience, and avoiding detection than on quick reflexes and firepower.
