Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on **cyberpunk aesthetics** and **trance/electronic music**. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It used vector graphics to create a sense of speed and a distinctive visual style, similar to *Star Fox* or *F-Zero*, but with a much more detailed and neon-drenched look.
*   **Tube-Like Tracks:**  Players raced along twisting, turning, tube-like tracks that snaked through a futuristic cityscape.
*   **Power-Ups:** Power-ups were present, allowing players to attack opponents or boost their speed.
*   **Emphasis on Music:** The game was deeply integrated with a trance/electronic soundtrack, intended to enhance the sense of speed and immersion. The music was dynamically linked to the gameplay, changing based on events in the race.
*   **Two Player Mode:** It was intended to feature a two-player mode.

Essentially, it was aiming to be a very visually and aurally striking, high-speed racer that would have stood out from the competition at the time. It's often described as a precursor to games like *Wipeout*, but with a more enclosed track design.
