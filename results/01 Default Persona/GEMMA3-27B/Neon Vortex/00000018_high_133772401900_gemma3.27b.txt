Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D scrolling shooter/racing game** with a strong emphasis on vector graphics and a futuristic, psychedelic aesthetic. 

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay elements as understood from surviving footage and developer commentary:

*   **Vector Graphics:** The game heavily utilized vector graphics, creating a clean, minimalist look with glowing lines and shapes. This was somewhat unusual for the time, as most games were moving towards textured polygons.
*   **3D Scrolling:** Players would control a ship flying through a series of abstract, 3D tunnels.
*   **Racing/Time Attack:** While it had elements of shooting, the core gameplay was more about navigating the courses as quickly as possible, similar to a racing game or time attack mode.
*   **Power-Ups:** The ship could collect power-ups to enhance its speed, firing capabilities, or shield.
*   **Psychedelic Visuals:** The game was meant to be visually striking, with vibrant colors, swirling patterns, and a generally trippy, immersive atmosphere.

Essentially, imagine a blend of *Star Fox*, *F-Zero*, and the visual style of *Rez* (though *Rez* came much later), all built with vector graphics.



It was cancelled due to technical challenges with the PlayStation 1 hardware at the time, specifically maintaining a consistent framerate with the complex vector graphics and 3D scrolling.
