Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but *very* different from typical racing games of the time. It's best described as a **vector-based, psychedelic, futuristic racer** with a strong emphasis on **trick-based gameplay**. 

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Vector Graphics:** Like *Stunt Car Racer* and *F-Zero*, it used vector graphics to create a minimalist, glowing world.
*   **Track Manipulation:** Players didn't just race *on* the track, they could *manipulate* it in real-time using 'trick' buttons. This allowed them to create ramps, loops, and other obstacles for themselves and opponents.
*   **Physics-Based:** The game was heavily reliant on physics, making crashes spectacular and rewarding skillful control.
*   **Psychedelic Visuals:** The game was intended to be a sensory overload with bright, neon colors and trippy effects.
*   **Multiplayer Focus:** It was designed with a strong emphasis on four-player split-screen multiplayer.

Essentially, it was aiming to be a blend of the speed and competition of *F-Zero* with the track-building and physics of *Stunt Car Racer*, all wrapped in a very distinctive aesthetic.



Unfortunately, despite being quite far along in development, it was cancelled in 1994 due to technical difficulties with the PlayStation hardware and concerns about the game being too difficult for mainstream audiences.  Gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, showcasing its unique vision.
