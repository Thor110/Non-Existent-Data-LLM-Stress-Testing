Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Like the games it emulated, you wouldn't control character movement, only aiming and shooting.
*   **FMV:** The entire game was rendered using pre-recorded full-motion video, giving it a cinematic look.
*   **Sci-Fi Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched world, as the title suggests.
*   **Branching Paths:** It was designed to have branching paths and multiple endings, adding replayability.
*   **Unique Gun:** It was meant to be played with a special light gun that had a recoil feature and a unique "energy shield" mechanic.



Unfortunately, the game was canceled shortly before release due to technical issues with the light gun and concerns about the quality of the FMV footage.  A playable demo was showcased at trade shows, and footage has surfaced online, giving a glimpse of what could have been.
