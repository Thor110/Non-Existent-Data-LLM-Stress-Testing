Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Players would move through pre-rendered 3D environments automatically, focusing on shooting targets.
*   **FMV cutscenes:** The game heavily featured live-action full-motion video sequences to tell the story and provide context.
*   **Branching paths:** It was planned to have multiple branching paths based on player actions, offering some replayability.
*   **Sci-Fi setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-lit cyberpunk world, as the name "Neon Vortex" suggests.
*   **Cover system:** Players could use cover to avoid enemy fire, a feature somewhat ahead of its time for the genre.

Essentially, Psygnosis was aiming to create a more cinematic and story-driven light gun experience than many of its competitors at the time. However, due to technical issues and the declining popularity of arcades/light gun games, the project was cancelled before release.
