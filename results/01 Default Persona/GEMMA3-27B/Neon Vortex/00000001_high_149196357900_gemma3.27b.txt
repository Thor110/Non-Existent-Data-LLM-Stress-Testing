Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Like *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*, you wouldn't control character movement, but rather aim and shoot at enemies as the game moved you through the environments.
*   **FMV:** The entire game was based on pre-rendered full-motion video footage, making it visually distinct for its time.
*   **Sci-Fi Setting:** It was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched city (hence the name!).
*   **Branching Paths:** The game was intended to have branching paths and multiple endings based on player choices and performance.
*   **Cover System:** A unique feature was a cover system where players could hide behind objects to avoid damage.
*   **Difficulty:** Was intended to be very difficult, with enemies able to kill you quickly.



Unfortunately, despite being fairly far along in development (a playable demo existed), Psygnosis cancelled *Neon Vortex* in 1994 due to concerns about the quality of the FMV and the rising popularity of 3D polygon graphics. It remained unreleased for many years, becoming a bit of a lost gem in gaming history.  Footage of the demo surfaced online in 2014, allowing people to finally see what the game was like.
