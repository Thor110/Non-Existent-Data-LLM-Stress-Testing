Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about it:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Shooter
*   **Gameplay:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies in pre-rendered, full-motion video scenes. It was designed to be fast-paced and action-packed.
*   **Setting:** A futuristic, cyberpunk world.
*   **Story:** Players take on the role of a bounty hunter tasked with taking down a powerful criminal syndicate.
*   **Technology:** It was pushing the boundaries of FMV technology at the time, aiming for high-quality video and smooth integration with the light gun gameplay.



Unfortunately, it was cancelled relatively late in development due to technical issues with the PlayStation hardware not being able to reliably handle the FMV and light gun input at a consistent frame rate. Psygnosis deemed it unplayable and ultimately shelved the project. Footage has surfaced over the years, confirming its existence and giving a glimpse of what could have been.
