Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on futuristic visuals and a unique control scheme. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

* **Vector Graphics:** It heavily utilized vector graphics, creating a striking, minimalist aesthetic reminiscent of *Star Wars* cockpit views or *F-Zero*.
* **"Wireframe" Racing:** The tracks and vehicles were largely constructed of wireframes, giving it a very distinct look for the time.
* **Rotational Control:**  Instead of directly steering, players controlled the *rotation* of their ship. This meant you'd spin your ship to align with the track's twists and turns, a mechanic that proved difficult for many testers.
* **Boost and Weapons:** It featured a boost mechanic and limited weapons to hinder opponents.
* **Multiple Perspectives:**  The game offered a choice of cockpit and third-person perspectives.
* **Amiga CD32 Focus:** It was primarily developed for the Amiga CD32, aiming to showcase the console's 3D capabilities.



While often described as a racing game, it was more akin to a futuristic, arcade-style "track racer" than a simulation. The core concept was about speed, reflexes, and mastering the unusual rotational control.  

The difficulty of the control scheme was a major factor in its cancellation. Psygnosis felt it was too difficult for the average player and wouldn't be commercially viable.
