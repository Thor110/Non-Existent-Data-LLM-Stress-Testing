Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Players would move through pre-rendered environments automatically.
*   **Light Gun Control:** It was designed to be played with a light gun (like the Menacer) to shoot at on-screen targets.
*   **Branching Paths/Multiple Endings:**  Like many FMV games, it was meant to feature choices that would affect the storyline and lead to different outcomes.
*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Story:** The player took on the role of a security operative tasked with investigating a conspiracy within a virtual reality network.



Despite being nearly complete, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled shortly before its planned release, reportedly due to concerns about the Menacer light gun's reliability and the growing saturation of the FMV genre.  Gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, confirming its *Virtua Cop*-like nature.
