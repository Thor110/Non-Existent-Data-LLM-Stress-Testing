Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but with a unique twist. It wasn't just about shooting targets; it incorporated elements of **puzzle-solving and branching narrative**.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Light Gun Shooter:** Players would use a light gun to interact with on-screen events.
*   **FMV:** The game heavily relied on full-motion video, featuring live actors and pre-rendered environments.
*   **Puzzle Elements:**  Players had to solve puzzles by shooting specific objects in the correct order or at the right time.
*   **Branching Storyline:**  The choices players made through their actions (shooting or not shooting certain things) would affect the story's outcome.  It was designed to have multiple endings.
*   **Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, cyberpunk world.

Essentially, it was trying to be a more interactive and story-driven light gun game than typical arcade shooters of the time, leaning into adventure game elements. It was often described as a mix of *Sewer Shark* (another FMV light gun game) and an adventure title.



Unfortunately, despite being nearly complete, it was cancelled shortly before release due to concerns about the growing market saturation of FMV games and the perceived lack of long-term appeal.  A playable demo circulated amongst gaming press, and footage has surfaced online, giving us a good idea of what it would have been like.
