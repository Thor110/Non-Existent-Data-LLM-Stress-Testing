Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but a very unique one. It wasn't about cars or planes, but about piloting **energy spheres** through abstract, neon-lit courses within a virtual reality network. 

Here's a breakdown of its key features and genre aspects:

*   **Virtual Reality Racing:** The game was heavily inspired by *Tron*, with a focus on a digital, virtual world.
*   **Energy-Based Gameplay:** Players controlled spheres of energy, not vehicles, and had to navigate complex tracks.
*   **Track Manipulation:** A key feature was the ability to *reshape* the track itself in real-time, creating new paths and obstacles. This was done through a system of "nodes" that could be manipulated.
*   **Puzzle Elements:** It wasn't just about speed; players needed to solve puzzles and strategically alter the track to progress.
*   **Multiplayer Focus:** It was designed with 2-player split-screen in mind, allowing players to directly interfere with each other's tracks.

While fundamentally a racing game, it also incorporated elements of puzzle-solving and track-building, making it a rather innovative and unusual title for its time. It's often described as a blend of *F-Zero*, *Wipeout*, and *Lemmings*, with a heavy dose of visual flair.
