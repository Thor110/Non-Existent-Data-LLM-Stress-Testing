Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D scrolling shooter/racer hybrid**. 

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It heavily utilized vector graphics, giving it a very distinct, minimalist, and glowing aesthetic reminiscent of *Star Fox* or *F-Zero*, but even more abstract.
*   **Track-Based Movement:** Players didn't freely fly, but were locked onto a pre-defined track that twisted and turned through neon-lit environments.
*   **Shooting Elements:**  You could shoot at enemies and obstacles along the track.
*   **Speed & Momentum:** The focus was on maintaining high speed and skillfully navigating the tracks. It was meant to be incredibly fast and challenging.
*   **Multiplayer:** It was designed with a strong emphasis on two-player competitive racing.

Essentially, imagine a futuristic racer like *F-Zero* combined with the shooting mechanics of *Star Fox*, but presented with a completely unique visual style.



Unfortunately, despite being quite far along in development, it was cancelled due to technical challenges with the PlayStation hardware at the time and concerns about its complexity and accessibility for a wider audience. It gained a cult following through leaked gameplay footage and screenshots.
