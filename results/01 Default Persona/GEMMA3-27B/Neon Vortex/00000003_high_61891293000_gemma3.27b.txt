Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but with a very unique twist. While most light gun games of the time focused on shooting targets, Neon Vortex was heavily focused on **deflection**. 

Instead of *shooting* enemies, the player used the light gun to **deflect lasers and other projectiles *back* at them**. The game was set in a neon-drenched, futuristic world and featured live-action actors and CGI effects. It was intended to be a fast-paced, action-packed experience that relied on reflexes and precision.

Think of it like a combination of *Sega Virtua Cop* (in terms of light gun gameplay) but with the core mechanic centered around reflecting attacks instead of directly damaging enemies.

It was quite ambitious for the time, aiming for a different feel than the standard "shoot everything" light gun formula.  Unfortunately, it was cancelled due to technical difficulties and concerns about its complexity and playability.
