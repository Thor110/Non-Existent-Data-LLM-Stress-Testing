Neon Vortex was intended to be a **first-person puzzle game** with a strong emphasis on atmosphere and non-violent gameplay. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **First-Person Perspective:** Players would navigate the game world from a first-person view.
*   **Puzzle Solving:** The core gameplay revolved around solving intricate puzzles within a complex, abstract, and neon-lit environment.
*   **Non-Violent:** Unlike many games of the time, it was designed without combat or enemies. The challenge came entirely from the puzzles themselves.
*   **Atmospheric & Abstract:** The game was visually striking, featuring a highly stylized, futuristic world made of glowing neon shapes and geometric structures. The focus was on creating a sense of immersion and mystery.
*   **Physics-Based:** Puzzles involved manipulating objects and utilizing physics to progress.
*   **Level Design:** Levels were described as labyrinthine and non-linear, encouraging exploration.



It's often described as being similar in concept to games like *The 7th Guest* or early *Myst*, but with a faster pace and a more modern, electronic aesthetic.

Sadly, despite being close to completion, *Neon Vortex* was cancelled by Psygnosis in 1994, reportedly due to concerns about its marketability and the rise of more action-oriented first-person shooters like *Doom*. However, playable builds have surfaced over the years, allowing players to experience the unique vision of this lost classic.
