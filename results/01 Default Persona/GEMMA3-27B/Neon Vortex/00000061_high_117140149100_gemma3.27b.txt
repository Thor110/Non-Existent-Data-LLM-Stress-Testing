Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Players would move through pre-rendered 3D environments automatically.
*   **Light Gun Control:** The game was designed to be played with a light gun, requiring players to aim and shoot at on-screen targets.
*   **Branching Paths:** Like other FMV shooters of the era, Neon Vortex featured branching paths and multiple endings depending on player choices and accuracy.
*   **Sci-Fi Setting:** The game was set in a futuristic, neon-lit city (hence the name) and involved fighting cyborg criminals.
*   **Live-Action Footage:** It used a lot of live-action footage for the characters and cutscenes.



It was ambitious for its time, aiming to push the boundaries of FMV technology, but ultimately was cancelled due to technical issues and the limitations of the PlayStation 1 hardware.  A playable demo was shown at trade shows, and footage has surfaced online, giving a good idea of what the game would have been like.
