Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but with a unique twist. It wasn't just about shooting targets. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **FMV:** The game used pre-rendered, full-motion video sequences for its environments and characters.
* **Light Gun:** It was designed to be played with a light gun peripheral (like the Menacer or similar).
* **Puzzle/Logic Elements:**  Crucially, *Neon Vortex* wasn't just about quick reflexes. The gameplay involved **manipulating the environment within the FMV scenes** using the light gun. You'd aim at specific objects to rotate platforms, change gravity, or activate mechanisms to create a path forward for your vehicle (a futuristic hovercraft). It was less about shooting *at* enemies and more about solving puzzles *within* the video.
* **Racing/Vehicle Combat:** The hovercraft element suggested a racing/vehicle combat component alongside the puzzle solving.

Essentially, it was aiming to be a blend of *Sega Virtua Cop* (light gun shooting) and *Myst* (puzzle solving), all within a cyberpunk, neon-drenched world.



Unfortunately, due to technical limitations with the hardware and the difficulty of syncing the light gun with the complex FMV environments, the game was never released.  A playable demo exists, and it shows off the core mechanics, highlighting how different it was from typical light gun games of the time.
