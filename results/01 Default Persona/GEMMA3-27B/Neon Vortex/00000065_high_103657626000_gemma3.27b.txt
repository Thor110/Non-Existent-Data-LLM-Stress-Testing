Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **On-rails shooter:** Players would move through pre-rendered environments automatically.
*   **Light gun control:** It was designed to be played with a light gun peripheral (specifically the Menacer light gun, though it wasn't exclusive to it).
*   **Branching paths/Multiple endings:**  The game aimed to offer choices and branching storylines based on player actions and shooting decisions, leading to different outcomes.
*   **Cyberpunk setting:** The game featured a futuristic, neon-drenched cyberpunk world.
*   **Emphasis on quick reactions and accuracy:** Like other light gun shooters of the time, it focused on fast reflexes and precise aiming.



While never released, footage and information about Neon Vortex suggest it was ambitious for its time, aiming to push the boundaries of FMV light gun games with its story and interactive elements.
