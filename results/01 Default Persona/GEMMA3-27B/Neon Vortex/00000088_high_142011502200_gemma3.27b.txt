Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but *very* different from most racing games of the time. It was a **vector-graphics based, futuristic racer with a strong emphasis on puzzle-solving and exploration within the tracks.**

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Vector Graphics:** Like *Stunt Race FX* (also by Psygnosis), it utilized vector graphics, giving it a clean, minimalist look. However, *Neon Vortex* pushed this further, with environments constructed entirely of glowing lines.
*   **Non-Linear Tracks:** Tracks weren't just simple point-to-point routes. They were complex, maze-like structures with multiple paths, hidden areas, and shortcuts.
*   **Puzzle Elements:** Players had to manipulate the track itself – rotating sections, activating bridges, and changing the layout – to progress. It wasn't just about speed, but about figuring out *how* to get through the course.
*   **Slow Pace:** It wasn't a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled racer. The emphasis was on methodical exploration and puzzle-solving, leading to a slower, more deliberate gameplay experience.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game aimed for a very atmospheric and surreal feel, with a focus on neon lighting and electronic music.



It's often described as a blend of *F-Zero*, *Stunt Race FX*, and a puzzle game. Sadly, it was cancelled late in development due to technical difficulties with the PlayStation hardware and concerns about its unconventional gameplay not appealing to a mass audience.  However, gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, giving a good idea of its innovative design.
