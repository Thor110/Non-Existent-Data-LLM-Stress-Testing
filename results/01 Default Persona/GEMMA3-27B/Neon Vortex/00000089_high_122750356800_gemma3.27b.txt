Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game with a strong emphasis on atmosphere and a unique "wireframe" visual style**. 

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **3D Racing:** It wasn't a traditional polygonal 3D racer. Instead, it used vector graphics – essentially drawing the tracks and vehicles as glowing lines.
*   **Atmospheric:** Psygnosis aimed for a very specific, moody atmosphere. It was inspired by *Tron* and cyberpunk aesthetics, with neon lights, pulsating music, and a sense of speed.
*   **Physics-based:** The game focused on a realistic physics model, meaning that collisions and handling were meant to be quite challenging and skill-based.
*   **Track Design:** Tracks were designed to be twisting, turning, and often looping, making navigation difficult.
*   **Multiplayer Focus:** A key feature was a planned 8-player multiplayer mode, which was ambitious for the time.



Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties (specifically getting it to run smoothly on the Amiga 1200 hardware) and the impending release of the PlayStation (which Psygnosis shifted focus to), *Neon Vortex* was cancelled and never officially released. However, playable builds have surfaced over the years, giving fans a glimpse of what could have been.
