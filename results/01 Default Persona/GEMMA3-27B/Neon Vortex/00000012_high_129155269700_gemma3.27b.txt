Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on futuristic, neon-lit tracks and a unique control system. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **3D Racing:** It was aiming to be a fully 3D racing experience, which was ambitious for the time (early 90s).
*   **Track Design:** Tracks were described as being visually striking, featuring neon lights, geometric shapes, and a sense of speed.  They were designed to be very twisty and challenging.
*   **Control System:** The game was notable for its *rotational* control scheme. Instead of directly steering left and right, players would rotate the entire track around their vehicle, effectively "steering" by manipulating the environment. This was meant to be a novel and skill-based approach.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game aimed for a cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic, similar to *Wipeout* (another Psygnosis title), but with a different focus on track manipulation.



Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties (specifically, getting the game to run smoothly on the Amiga hardware) and the rising popularity of the PlayStation, Psygnosis cancelled the project. A playable demo exists, and has been released online, allowing players to experience its unique gameplay.
