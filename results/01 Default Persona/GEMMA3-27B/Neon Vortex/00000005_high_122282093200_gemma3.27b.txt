Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game with a strong emphasis on futuristic, neon-lit environments and a unique "gravity-defying" control scheme.**

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

*   **Genre:** Primarily a racing game, but with elements of arcade action and a focus on skillful maneuvering.
*   **Gameplay:** Players controlled a ship-like vehicle through twisting, looping tracks constructed from neon-glowing geometric shapes. The key feature was the ability to rotate the entire playfield *around* the vehicle, effectively changing gravity and allowing for unconventional racing lines. Think a blend of F-Zero's speed, Wipeout's aesthetic, and a control scheme that played with perspective.
*   **Perspective:** Third-person, following behind the vehicle.
*   **Platforms:** Originally in development for the PlayStation and Amiga.
*   **Visual Style:** Highly stylized, with a vibrant, neon-infused cyberpunk aesthetic.  It was aiming to push the graphical capabilities of the platforms at the time.



Despite being highly anticipated and featuring impressive technology for its time, Neon Vortex was ultimately cancelled due to technical difficulties and concerns about its complex control scheme being too difficult for mainstream players.  Gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, showcasing what could have been a truly innovative racing title.
