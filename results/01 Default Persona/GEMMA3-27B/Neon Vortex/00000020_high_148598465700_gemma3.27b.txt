Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but *very* different from typical racing games of the time. It's best described as a **vector-based, psychedelic, futuristic racer** with a heavy emphasis on **trance-inducing visuals and music**. 

Here's a breakdown of its key features and how it differed:

*   **Vector Graphics:** Like *Stunt Car Racer* (also by Psygnosis), it used vector graphics, creating a minimalist, wireframe look. However, Neon Vortex pushed this much further, with incredibly complex and constantly shifting patterns.
*   **Trance/Electronic Music:** The game was designed to be experienced with electronic music that synced with the visuals, aiming to create a hypnotic and immersive experience. The soundtrack was a major component.
*   **Non-Traditional Tracks:** Tracks weren't typical circuits. They were more like abstract, flowing pathways through a neon-lit, virtual space.
*   **Gameplay Focus:** While you raced, the emphasis wasn't just on speed. It was about *feeling* the experience, navigating the visually intense environments, and being drawn into the rhythm of the game. It was less about winning and more about the journey.
* **"Flow State" Design:** The developers aimed for a "flow state" where the player would become completely absorbed in the game, losing track of time and experiencing a sense of euphoria.



Unfortunately, it was never released due to technical challenges with the PlayStation hardware at the time (specifically, the limitations in handling the complex vector graphics and the desire to maintain a smooth framerate).  Footage of the game is rare, but what exists shows a truly unique and ambitious title that was ahead of its time.
