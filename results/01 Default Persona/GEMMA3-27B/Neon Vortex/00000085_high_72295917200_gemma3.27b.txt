Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by games like *Savage Encounter* and *Rebel Assault*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **FMV-based:** The entire game was constructed using pre-recorded full-motion video footage.
*   **Light Gun Control:** Players would have used a light gun (like the Menacer) to shoot at on-screen objects and enemies.
*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** It was set in a futuristic, cyberpunk world with a neon aesthetic (hence the name).
*   **On-Rails Movement:** The game would have featured on-rails movement, meaning the player's character moved automatically through the environments, and the player focused solely on aiming and shooting.
*   **Interactive Story:** It was intended to have a branching storyline with multiple endings, depending on the player's choices and shooting accuracy.



It was ambitious for its time, but ultimately cancelled due to technical challenges with the Menacer light gun and the difficulty of creating a compelling experience with the limitations of FMV technology at the time.
