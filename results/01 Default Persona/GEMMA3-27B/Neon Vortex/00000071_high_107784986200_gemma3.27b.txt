Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game with a strong emphasis on futuristic, vector graphics and a unique "gravity-defying" control scheme.** 

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Vector Graphics:**  Like *Star Wars* arcade games or *F-Zero* on the SNES, it used simple lines and shapes to create a minimalist, high-speed aesthetic.
*   **Gravity-Defying Tracks:** The tracks weren't just about turning left and right. Players could flip and rotate their ship around the track, essentially flying around the inside of the courses. This was a core mechanic.
*   **Fast Paced:**  It was designed to be *very* fast, aiming for a sense of extreme speed.
*   **Multiplayer Focus:** It was intended to have a robust multiplayer mode, which was a key selling point.
*   **Amiga CD32 & PlayStation:** It was being developed for both the Amiga CD32 and the original PlayStation.



Unfortunately, due to various issues (reportedly technical difficulties getting the game to run smoothly on both platforms, and Psygnosis shifting focus to other titles like *Wipeout*), it was never released.  However, playable demos and footage have surfaced over the years, giving us a good understanding of what it would have been like.
