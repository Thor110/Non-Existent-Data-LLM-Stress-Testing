Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on **neon-lit, futuristic environments and a unique control scheme**. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It used vector graphics to create a distinct visual style, similar to games like *Star Wars* arcade or *F-Zero*.
*   **Rotational Movement:** Players controlled a ship that rotated around a central axis, and the track rotated around the player. This created a disorienting but exciting sense of speed.
*   **Power-Ups:** It featured power-ups to help players gain an edge over opponents.
*   **Multiplayer:** It was designed to support up to 8 players via a network.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game aimed for a cyberpunk aesthetic with bright neon colors and a thumping soundtrack.

Essentially, it was an attempt to push the boundaries of 3D racing on the Amiga, and it's often compared to *F-Zero* in terms of speed and intensity, but with a very different visual and control style.
