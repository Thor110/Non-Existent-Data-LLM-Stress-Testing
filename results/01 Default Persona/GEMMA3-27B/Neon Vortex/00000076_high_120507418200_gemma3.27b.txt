Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing/shooter hybrid**, often described as a futuristic, psychedelic take on *F-Zero* or *Wipeout*, but with a much stronger emphasis on shooting enemy ships while racing. 

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay elements as understood from surviving footage and developer interviews:

*   **Fast-Paced Racing:** Players controlled a ship racing on futuristic tracks.
*   **Weapon System:** Unlike *Wipeout*'s primarily pickup-based weapons, *Neon Vortex* featured a more complex system where players could *aim* and fire at opponents.
*   **Track Interaction:** The tracks weren't just for racing; they had interactive elements and hazards.
*   **Psychedelic Visuals:** As the name suggests, the game was heavily focused on vibrant, abstract, and trippy graphics. It aimed for a very different aesthetic than *Wipeout*, leaning into a more "rave" or "cyberpunk" look.
*   **Unique Control Scheme:** It used a novel control scheme that involved tilting the joystick to steer and buttons for weapons and special abilities.



The game was cancelled due to technical difficulties (specifically with the PlayStation hardware at the time) and differing visions between the development team. It gained a cult following over the years due to its mysterious status and intriguing gameplay concepts.
