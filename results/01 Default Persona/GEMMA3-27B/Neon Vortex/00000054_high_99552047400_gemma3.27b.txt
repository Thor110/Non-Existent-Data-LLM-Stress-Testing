Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, but with a very unique twist. It wasn't just about shooting targets.

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay concept:

*   **FMV & Live Actors:** The game used pre-recorded full-motion video footage of live actors in a futuristic, neon-lit setting.
*   **Branching Narrative:** The core mechanic was *not* just accuracy with the light gun. Players had to make choices *how* to shoot (headshots, disarming, etc.) and *what* to shoot at.  These choices affected the story, leading to multiple endings and different paths through the game.
*   **Moral Choices:** The game heavily emphasized moral ambiguity. Players weren't simply "good guys" shooting "bad guys." They were presented with situations where there wasn't a clear right or wrong answer, and their actions had consequences.
*   **Psychological Thriller:** The game aimed to be more of a psychological thriller than a straightforward action game, focusing on the player's reactions to the scenarios presented.

Essentially, it was trying to be a more interactive and morally complex version of games like *Sewer Shark* or *Mad Dog McCree*, but with a much stronger focus on narrative and player agency.



It was ambitious for the time, but technical limitations and the declining popularity of FMV games led to its cancellation.  Footage has surfaced over the years, giving a good idea of what it would have been like. You can find videos of it on YouTube.
