Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing/shooter hybrid** with a strong emphasis on **vector graphics and a futuristic aesthetic**. 

Here's a breakdown of what it was aiming to be:

*   **Racing:** Players would control a ship racing through abstract, neon-lit courses.
*   **Shooting:**  Players could fire at opponents and obstacles.
*   **Vector Graphics:** The game was notable for its planned use of pure vector graphics, similar to games like *Stunt Car Racer* (also by Psygnosis), but far more complex and visually striking.
*   **Atmosphere:** The game was intended to create a sense of speed and immersion through its visuals and sound design, with a focus on a cyberpunk/futuristic vibe.

Essentially, imagine a blend of *F-Zero*, *Stunt Car Racer*, and a dash of *Wipeout*, but with a unique visual style that heavily leveraged vector graphics.



Unfortunately, the game was cancelled relatively late in development due to technical challenges with getting the vector graphics to run smoothly on the PlayStation 1 hardware.  Footage and information about the game have surfaced over the years, showcasing its ambitious design and potential.
