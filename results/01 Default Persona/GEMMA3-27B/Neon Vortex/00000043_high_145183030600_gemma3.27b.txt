Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but a very unique one. It wasn't about cars or planes, but about **navigating a vector-based ship through abstract, neon-lit tunnels**. 

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It used entirely vector graphics, giving it a very clean, minimalist, and futuristic look, similar to *Stunt Race FX* (also by Psygnosis) but even more abstract.
*   **Tunnel Racer:** Players controlled a ship that moved along a pre-defined track within these tunnels. The goal was to stay on the track and complete the course as quickly as possible.
*   **Track Switching:** The key mechanic was the ability to switch between multiple parallel tracks within the tunnel. This was done to avoid obstacles, collect power-ups, and find the fastest route.
*   **Physics-Based Handling:** The ship's handling was reportedly physics-based, making it feel more dynamic and less arcade-like than traditional racers.
*   **Emphasis on Speed and Flow:** The game aimed for a feeling of intense speed and a smooth, flowing experience.



Essentially, it was a blend of *F-Zero*, *Stunt Race FX*, and a touch of *Marble Madness*, but with a distinctive visual style and unique track-switching mechanic. It was aiming to be a visually striking and innovative take on the racing genre.

Unfortunately, due to various development issues and Psygnosis's focus shifting towards full 3D graphics, Neon Vortex was ultimately cancelled and never released. However, gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, giving a good idea of what the game would have been like.
