Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but *highly* unconventional for the time. It wasn't about speed in the traditional sense, but about **navigating a complex, abstract, and geometrically shifting 3D world**. 

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay:

*   **Vector-based graphics:** The game used entirely vector-based graphics, creating a very clean, minimalist look reminiscent of early arcade games like *Battlezone* or *Starlight*.
*   **"Flow" based racing:** Instead of a track, players navigated through a network of interconnected pathways made of glowing neon lines. The goal wasn't to be the fastest, but to maintain "flow" – staying on the pathways and avoiding collisions.
*   **Dynamic Geometry:** The pathways would constantly shift, rotate, and change shape in real-time, creating a disorienting but visually stunning experience.
*   **Trance-inducing atmosphere:** The game aimed for a hypnotic, psychedelic atmosphere with a focus on ambient music and visuals.
*   **Multiplayer Focus:** It was designed with a strong multiplayer component, intended to be played with up to 8 players.

Essentially, it was a blend of racing, puzzle, and atmospheric exploration. It's often described as a "cyberpunk *Battlezone*" or a "virtual reality racer" due to its unique aesthetic and gameplay.

It was never released due to technical challenges (getting it to run smoothly on the Amiga hardware was proving difficult) and Psygnosis's shift in focus towards full-motion video games. However, gameplay footage has surfaced, and it's become something of a cult classic among retro gaming enthusiasts.
