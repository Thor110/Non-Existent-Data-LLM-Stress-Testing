Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by games like *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

However, it wasn't just a simple "shoot the bad guys" game. It was unique in that it featured a **narrative that changed based on *how* you shot**.  Instead of just hitting targets, the game tracked *where* you shot on the screen. Shooting civilians, or shooting things out of order, would alter the story and lead to different endings. 

Think of it as an early attempt at branching narrative in a light gun shooter, with a focus on consequence for your actions beyond just accuracy. It was ambitious for its time, but ultimately deemed too complex and buggy for release.
