Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by games like *Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **Light Gun Control:** Players would use a light gun to shoot enemies and interact with the on-screen action.
*   **FMV Sequences:** The game was built around pre-recorded full-motion video sequences, featuring actors and environments.
*   **Cyberpunk Setting:** The game had a futuristic, cyberpunk aesthetic with a neon-drenched visual style.
*   **Branching Paths:** It was designed with branching storylines and multiple endings, based on player choices and accuracy.
*   **Interactive Environments:** Some environments were interactive, allowing players to shoot objects for points or to reveal hidden pathways.

Unfortunately, despite being quite far into development, *Neon Vortex* was canceled by Psygnosis shortly before its planned release due to concerns about the quality of the FMV and the increasing competition in the light gun shooter market. A playable demo did circulate among gaming press at the time.
