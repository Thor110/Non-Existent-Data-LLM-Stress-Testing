Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but a *very* unusual one. It wasn't about cars or planes, but about **vector graphics "light cycles" racing through a virtual reality landscape**. 

Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

*   **Vector Graphics:** The entire game world and racers were constructed from simple, glowing vector lines - reminiscent of the original *Tron* arcade game.
*   **VR Aesthetic:** It aimed to simulate a virtual reality experience, with a first-person perspective and a sense of speed and immersion.
*   **Track Creation:** The tracks weren't pre-defined; they were *generated in real-time* based on the player's actions and the music.  The music would influence the shape and speed of the track.
*   **Abstract Gameplay:** Rather than traditional racing, you'd be navigating and manipulating these vector trails, dodging obstacles, and trying to stay ahead. It was more about "flowing" through the environment than strict competition.
*   **Psygnosis's ambition:** It was a highly ambitious project for its time, pushing the limits of the PlayStation hardware.



It's often described as a blend of *Wipeout* (another Psygnosis racing game) and *Rez* (a later rhythm-action game), though it predates both.  It's become something of a legendary "lost game" due to its unique concept and the limited footage available.
