Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, heavily inspired by games like *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

However, it wasn't *just* a light gun game. It also incorporated elements of a **racing game**. Players would shoot at targets while simultaneously steering a futuristic vehicle along a track. The combination was quite ambitious for the time and proved technically challenging.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Genre:** FMV Light Gun Racing Shooter
*   **Gameplay:** Players used a light gun to shoot targets appearing on screen while also controlling the direction of a vehicle navigating a neon-lit, futuristic track.
*   **Setting:** A cyberpunk/futuristic world.
*   **Technical Challenges:** The game aimed for a very fast pace and complex visuals, which pushed the limitations of the PlayStation 1 hardware at the time. This is a major reason it was ultimately cancelled.
