Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on **vector graphics and a futuristic aesthetic**. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about the gameplay:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It was heavily inspired by games like *Star Wars* (the arcade vector game) and *F-Zero*, utilizing minimalist, glowing lines to create the tracks and ships.
*   **Speed & Momentum:** The game was designed to be incredibly fast, requiring players to maintain momentum and skillfully navigate tight, twisting courses.
*   **Track Design:** Tracks were described as complex, multi-layered, and designed to disorient players. They featured loops, corkscrews, and narrow passages.
*   **Power-Ups:** Power-ups were included to help players gain an edge, like speed boosts and weapons.
*   **Multiplayer:** It was planned to have a two-player split-screen mode.
*   **Amiga CD32 Focus:** It was being developed primarily for the Amiga CD32, aiming to showcase the console's capabilities.

Essentially, think of it as a precursor to games like *Wipeout* (also by Psygnosis) but even more raw and stripped-down in its visual style. It was aiming for a pure speed and arcade feel.



Unfortunately, it was cancelled late in development due to technical challenges with the Amiga CD32 hardware and concerns about its commercial viability.  Footage and information about it resurfaced over the years, becoming a bit of a legend among Amiga enthusiasts.
