Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing game**, but *very* different from typical racers of the time. It was a **vector-graphics based, futuristic racer with a strong emphasis on puzzle-solving and exploration within the tracks.**

Here's a breakdown of what made it unique:

*   **Non-linear Tracks:** Unlike traditional linear racing games, Neon Vortex tracks were complex, branching networks of interconnected tubes and pathways. Players weren't just racing *around* a track, but *through* a maze-like structure.
*   **Puzzle Elements:** Players had to manipulate the track itself - rotating sections, activating bridges, and changing pathways - to create a viable route to the finish line.  It was less about pure speed and more about figuring out *how* to get through the course.
*   **Vector Graphics:**  The game used a distinctive vector graphics style (like early *Star Wars* arcade games or *Stunt Race FX*), giving it a clean, minimalist aesthetic.
*   **First-Person Perspective:**  It was played from a first-person cockpit view.
*   **Atmospheric and Ambient:**  Psygnosis aimed for a very atmospheric experience with ambient electronic music and a focus on creating a sense of speed and immersion.



Essentially, it was trying to blend the speed of a racing game with the brain-teasing elements of a puzzle game, all wrapped in a visually striking package. It's often described as a precursor to games like *F-Zero GX* or *Wipeout* but with much more emphasis on track manipulation and puzzle solving.



Unfortunately, it was cancelled late in development due to technical difficulties and concerns about its unconventional gameplay being too difficult for a mass audience.  Gameplay footage has surfaced over the years, showcasing its unique vision.
