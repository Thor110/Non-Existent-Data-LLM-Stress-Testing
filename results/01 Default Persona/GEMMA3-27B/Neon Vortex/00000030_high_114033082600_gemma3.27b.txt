Neon Vortex was intended to be a **fast-paced, 3D racing game** with a strong emphasis on **futuristic, psychedelic visuals**. 

Here's a breakdown of what we know about its gameplay:

*   **Vector Graphics:** It utilized vector graphics to create a unique and minimalist aesthetic. Think *Star Wars* arcade game style, but with bright, neon colors.
*   **Tube-Based Tracks:** Races took place within twisting, turning, and looping tube-like tracks.
*   **Speed & Momentum:** The game was designed to be incredibly fast, and maintaining momentum was key.
*   **Power-Ups:** Players could collect power-ups to gain advantages.
*   **Multiple Perspectives:** It featured different camera angles, including a behind-the-ship view and a more distant, strategic view.
*   **Two-Player Mode:**  A split-screen two-player mode was planned.

Essentially, it was aiming to be a blend of *F-Zero*, *Wipeout*, and the visual style of early 90s psychedelic art. It was ambitious for its time, pushing the limits of the Amiga 1200 hardware.
