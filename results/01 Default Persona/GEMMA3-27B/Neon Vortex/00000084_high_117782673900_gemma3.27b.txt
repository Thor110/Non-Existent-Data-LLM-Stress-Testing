Neon Vortex was intended to be a **racing/shooter hybrid** with a strong emphasis on **vector graphics** and a **trance-like, psychedelic aesthetic**. 

Here's a breakdown of the gameplay as understood from demos and descriptions:

*   **Vector Graphics:** The game used a minimalist, wireframe-based visual style reminiscent of early arcade games like *Battlezone* or *Star Wars*.
*   **Racing:** Players controlled a ship racing through abstract, neon-lit courses.
*   **Shooting:**  Players could fire at obstacles and enemies along the track.
*   **Trance/Psychedelic:** The game aimed for a hypnotic and immersive experience with pulsing visuals, a driving soundtrack, and a focus on speed and flow.
*   **Unique Control Scheme:** It was meant to use a unique control scheme that allowed players to "paint" their trajectory with the joystick.



It was often described as a blend of *F-Zero*, *Stunt Race FX*, and elements of the psychedelic visuals found in games like *Rez*.

Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties and the impending launch of the PlayStation, Psygnosis cancelled the project before it was released. However, a playable demo circulated among enthusiasts, and it's gained a cult following over the years.
