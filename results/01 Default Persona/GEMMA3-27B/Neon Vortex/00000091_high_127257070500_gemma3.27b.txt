Neon Vortex was intended to be a **full-motion video (FMV) light gun shooter**, similar to games like *Sega Virtua Cop* and *Time Crisis*. 

However, it was *much* more ambitious than those. Here's a breakdown of its intended gameplay:

*   **FMV Based:** The entire game was rendered using pre-recorded full-motion video footage of actors and sets.
*   **Branching Narrative:**  It wasn't a linear shooter. Player choices and performance *during* the shooting sequences would affect the storyline and lead to different paths and endings. This was a significant feature for the time.
*   **Complex Story:** The game had a fairly involved sci-fi plot about a detective investigating a virtual reality crime.
*   **Multiple Playable Characters:** Players could switch between different characters, each with their own skills and perspectives on the story.
*   **Unique Gun Control:** It was designed to use a special light gun that had a recoil feature and a "focus" button, allowing for more precise aiming and interaction with the FMV environments.



Unfortunately, due to technical challenges (particularly getting the game to run smoothly on the PlayStation 1 hardware with all the FMV) and development difficulties, it was ultimately cancelled.  A playable demo did circulate, and footage has emerged online, giving a glimpse of what could have been a very innovative title.
