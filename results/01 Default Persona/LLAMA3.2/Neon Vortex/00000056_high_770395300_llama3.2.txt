I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find that there is a cancelled game called 'Neon Vortex' which was announced in 1993 for the Sega Saturn. Unfortunately it never materialized and no gameplay footage or images of this game have surfaced over the years
