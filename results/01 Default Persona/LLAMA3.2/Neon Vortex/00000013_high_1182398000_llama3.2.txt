I couldn't find any information about a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I can suggest some possible games that may be related:

* There is an unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" but no further info could be found on it.
* Another possibility is the cancelled PlayStation game "Neon Vortex" which was supposed to be released in 1994 for the PlayStation console. However, there's limited information about this title.

If you have more information or clarification about the game, I'd be happy to help you further.
