I couldn't find any information about a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that it may not exist or is a mythical game.

However, I did find some information on a cancelled game called "Neon Vortex" which was in development by Psygnosis (now defunct) around the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, there's limited information available about this specific project.
