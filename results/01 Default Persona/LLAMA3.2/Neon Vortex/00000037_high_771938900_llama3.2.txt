I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that it may have been a prototype or an unannounced project, but I couldn't find any reliable sources confirming its existence. If you have more context or details about the game, I'd be happy to try and help further.
