I couldn't find any information about a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that it may be a lesser-known or obscure game, or it could be incorrect. If you have any more information or clarification about the game, I'd be happy to try and help you further.

However, I did find information on a 1994 Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex" for the Sega CD console in North America, released as part of the Sega CD's 3D graphics capability.
