I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis, or it may be a concept or prototype that was never completed.

If you have any more information about the game, such as any screenshots, box art, or gameplay details, I may be able to help you identify it.
