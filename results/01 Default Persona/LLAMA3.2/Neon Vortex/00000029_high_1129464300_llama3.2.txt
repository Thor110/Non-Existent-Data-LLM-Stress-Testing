I couldn't find any information about a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that you may be thinking of a different game or have incorrect information.

However, I did find some information on a game called "Neon Vortex" that was actually released in 2002 by Psygnosis for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. This game is an action-adventure game with 3D graphics, but I couldn't find any details about a 1994 unreleased version of this game.
