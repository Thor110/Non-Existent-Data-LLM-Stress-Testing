I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex." It's possible that you may have incorrect or incomplete information. If you could provide more context or details about this game, I'd be happy to try and help further.

However, I can suggest some alternatives:

1. Check online databases such as MobyGames or Giant Bomb for unreleased games from Psygnosis.
2. Look up the company's official website or social media channels to see if they have any information on an unreleased game with this title.
3. Reach out to gaming forums or communities, such as ResetEra or GameFAQs, and ask if anyone remembers a game called Neon Vortex from Psygnosis.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
