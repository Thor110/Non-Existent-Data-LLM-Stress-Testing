I couldn't find any information about a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that it may be a non-existent or unknown game, or it could be a misremembered or incorrect title.

Psygnosis was a British video game developer and publisher known for their work on several classic games in the 1980s and 1990s, including Wipeout, Destruction Derby, and Lemmings. If you have any more information about Neon Vortex, I may be able to help you further.
