I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called "Neon Vortex". However, I did find information on a game called "Neon Vortex" that was announced in 2001 by Psygnosis and was later cancelled. 

If you're referring to the original Neon Vortex announcement in 2001, I couldn't find any details about its genre or gameplay mechanics.
