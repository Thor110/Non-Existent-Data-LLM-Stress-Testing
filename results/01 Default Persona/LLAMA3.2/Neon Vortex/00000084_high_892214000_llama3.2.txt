I couldn't find any information on a 1994 unreleased Psygnosis game called Neon Vortex. It's possible that this game was never officially announced or released by Psygnosis, or it may be a myth with no basis in fact.

If you have any more information about the game, such as a screenshot or a description, I may be able to help you identify what type of game it was supposed to be.
