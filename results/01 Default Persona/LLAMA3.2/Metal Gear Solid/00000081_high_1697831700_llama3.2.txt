Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the pioneers of the stealth genre.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy bases to gather intelligence and neutralize threats. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using various camouflage tools, disguises, and gadgets to remain undetected.

The game features elements of action, exploration, puzzle-solving, and strategy, which have since become staples of the Metal Gear series. Its innovative gameplay mechanics and storytelling set a new standard for stealth games, influencing many other titles in the genre.

Over time, Metal Gear Solid has expanded to include sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, cementing its place as one of the most iconic and influential video game franchises of all time.
