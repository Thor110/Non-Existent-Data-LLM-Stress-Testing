1. Stealth mechanics: Players must use stealth tactics, such as hiding in shadows, using camouflage, and creating diversions, to avoid detection.
2. Exploration: The game features a vast, open-world environment that players can explore, completing side quests and finding hidden items.
3. Action sequences: When detected or when Snake is forced to fight, the game transitions into action-packed sequences with intense combat and platforming challenges.
