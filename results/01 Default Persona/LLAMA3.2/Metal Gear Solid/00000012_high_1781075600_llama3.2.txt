Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the greatest games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special operative who must infiltrate enemy territory to neutralize threats and gather intelligence. The gameplay focuses on stealth, strategy, and tactics, as players must sneak past or evade enemies, rather than engaging in direct combat.

The game features a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and action elements, with an emphasis on sneaking around and using camouflage to remain undetected. The game's innovative use of 3D gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and memorable characters helped establish it as a landmark title in the stealth genre.

Metal Gear Solid is also notable for its complex storyline, which explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the nature of war, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay experience.
