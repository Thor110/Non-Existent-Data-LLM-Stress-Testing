Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console.

The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, rather than engaging in direct combat. The player controls Solid Snake, a special forces operative, as he infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize threats and uncover conspiracies.

Key features of Metal Gear Solid include:

1. Stealth mechanics: Players must use stealth, camouflage, and disguises to evade detection.
2. Tactical gameplay: Snake must use his skills and equipment, such as the Silencer Covert Sniper Rifle and the Thermite Grenade, to take out enemies without being detected.
3. Puzzle-solving: Players often need to solve puzzles or bypass security systems to progress through the game.
4. Exploration: The game features a large open world that players can explore, including hidden areas and secret paths.

Metal Gear Solid's innovative gameplay mechanics and storytelling set it apart from other action-adventure games of its time, and it has become a classic in the stealth genre.
