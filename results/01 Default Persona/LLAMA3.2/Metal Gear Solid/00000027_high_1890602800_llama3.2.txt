Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Konami. The game combines elements of stealth, strategy, and action, with a strong focus on storytelling and character development.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who must infiltrate a heavily fortified enemy base to neutralize a threat known as " FOXDIE" (a fictional virus that can be used to control people's minds). The gameplay involves stealth, sneaking, and strategy, as Snake must evade detection by the enemy soldiers and complete objectives while avoiding being caught.

The game introduced many innovative elements to the stealth genre, such as the use of radar and thermal imaging to detect enemies, and the ability to disguise oneself as enemy soldiers. It also featured a complex plot with multiple twists and turns, which has become a hallmark of the Metal Gear series.

Overall, Metal Gear Solid is considered a classic game in the stealth genre, and its influence can still be seen in many modern games today.
