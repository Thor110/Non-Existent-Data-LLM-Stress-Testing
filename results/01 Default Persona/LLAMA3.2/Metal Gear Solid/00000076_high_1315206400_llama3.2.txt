Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It combines elements of stealth, action, and survival horror to create a unique gaming experience. The game follows the story of Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a threat.

The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently eliminating enemies using stealth tactics, such as hiding in shadows, using camouflage suits, and disguises. The player must also navigate through levels, solving puzzles, and completing objectives while avoiding detection by the enemy.

Metal Gear Solid is considered one of the pioneering games in the stealth genre, influencing many subsequent stealth games and action-adventure titles.
