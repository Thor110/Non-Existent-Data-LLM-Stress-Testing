Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console.

The gameplay involves sneaking around, gathering intel, and completing objectives without being detected by enemies, often using disguises, camouflage, and stealth tactics to evade detection. The game also features elements of strategy, puzzle-solving, and exploration.

Some key features of Metal Gear Solid include:

1. Stealth mechanics: Players must use stealth to sneak past or silently take out enemies.
2. Disguise system: Characters can wear different costumes to change their appearance and behavior, helping them blend in with the environment.
3. Hacking systems: Players can hack electronic devices to disable alarms, cameras, and other security measures.
4. Camouflage: The game features a camouflage system that allows characters to become harder to detect by hiding or disguising themselves.

The gameplay of Metal Gear Solid has had a significant influence on the stealth genre and has inspired numerous other games, including many in the Metal Gear series itself.
