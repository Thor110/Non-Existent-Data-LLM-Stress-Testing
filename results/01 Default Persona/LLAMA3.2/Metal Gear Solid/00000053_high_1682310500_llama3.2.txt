Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. The game combines elements of stealth, strategy, and action gameplay with a strong narrative focus.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative tasked with infiltrating enemy territory to neutralize a threat. The game features a variety of stealth mechanics, such as sneaking past guards, using disguises, and hacking turrets to gain an advantage.

However, Metal Gear Solid also includes action-packed sequences, where the player must engage in combat with enemies, avoid traps, and navigate through treacherous terrain. The game's narrative is heavily focused on storytelling, character development, and themes of identity, loyalty, and the ethics of war.

The game's success helped establish the stealth genre as a major force in gaming, and it has since become a classic of the medium.
