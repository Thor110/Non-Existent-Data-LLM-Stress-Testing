Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become one of the most iconic and influential games in the gaming industry.

In Metal Gear Solid, players take on the role of Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a terrorist threat. The gameplay involves stealth, strategy, and action elements, as Snake must sneak past or defeat enemies without being detected, while also completing objectives and uncovering the story behind the game's narrative.

The game introduced many innovative features that have since become standard in the stealth genre, such as:

* A focus on stealth and strategy over raw combat
* A "stealth meter" that tracks Snake's ability to remain undetected
* A variety of camouflage options and disguises to help players evade detection
* A branching narrative with multiple endings

Metal Gear Solid has spawned numerous sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, among others.
