Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, rather than engaging in direct combat. Players control Solid Snake, a soldier who must infiltrate enemy territories and gather information while avoiding detection.

The game features a mix of stealth mechanics, such as hiding, disguise, and lockpicking, with action elements like shooting and melee combat. The goal is to complete objectives without alerting the enemy or causing unnecessary destruction.

Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is widely considered one of the greatest games of all time, influencing the stealth genre and gaming as a whole.
