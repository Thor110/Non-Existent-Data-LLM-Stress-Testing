Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative, as he infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a threat known as "Metal Gear REX," a highly advanced mobile nuclear-armed tank. The gameplay involves stealth, strategy, and puzzle-solving, as Snake must sneak past or disable enemies without being detected.

Key features of the game include:

* Stealth mechanics: Players can use shadows, camouflage, and disguises to evade detection.
* Hacking: Snake can hack into electronic devices, such as cameras and turrets, to gain access or disable them.
* Platforming: The game features a variety of environments, from indoor missions to outdoor terrain, requiring Snake to navigate through complex levels.

Metal Gear Solid's innovative gameplay mechanics, storytelling, and cinematic presentation set the standard for future stealth games and influenced many other titles in the action-adventure genre.
