Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become one of the most iconic games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special operative who must infiltrate enemy territory to neutralize a threat known as FOXDIE (a fictional computer virus). The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently eliminating enemies using stealth tactics, avoiding detection by patrolling guards and security systems. The game also features action-packed sequences where Snake must fight his way out of situations.

Metal Gear Solid is widely regarded as one of the greatest games ever made, known for its engaging storyline, memorable characters, and innovative gameplay mechanics that have influenced many other stealth games in the years since its release.
