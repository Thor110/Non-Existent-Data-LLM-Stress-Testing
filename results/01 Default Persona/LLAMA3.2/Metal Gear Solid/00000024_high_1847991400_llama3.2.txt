Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is widely considered a classic in the gaming industry.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territories to gather intelligence, disable nuclear missiles, and complete other objectives while avoiding detection by the game's enemies. The game features a mix of stealth, strategy, and action elements, with an emphasis on sneaking past or eliminating enemies undetected.

The game was groundbreaking at the time for its 3D gameplay, story-driven narrative, and innovative camera system, which allowed players to control Snake's movements while also providing a third-person view. Metal Gear Solid has since become a beloved franchise with numerous sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, including games like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.
