Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. Released in 1998 for the PlayStation, it is widely considered one of the greatest games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative who must infiltrate enemy territory to neutralize threats and uncover conspiracies. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, avoiding detection, and solving puzzles to progress through the story.

Metal Gear Solid introduced many innovative features that have since become standard in stealth games, such as:

1. Camera-based stealth mechanics: Players could use a variety of cameras to scout out areas, reveal hidden enemies, and plan their approach.
2. Hiding spots: Snake could hide in various objects or environments to avoid detection.
3. Disguises: Snake could wear disguises to blend in with his surroundings and gain access to restricted areas.
4. Combat system: While stealth was the primary focus, players could engage in combat if necessary, using a variety of firearms and non-lethal options.

Metal Gear Solid's success spawned a beloved franchise with numerous sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, cementing its place as a classic in the world of gaming.
