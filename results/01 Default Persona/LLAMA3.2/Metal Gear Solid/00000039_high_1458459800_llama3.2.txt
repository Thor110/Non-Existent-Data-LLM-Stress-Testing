Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It's a third-person shooter with stealth elements, where the player must use strategy and sneaking abilities to complete objectives without being detected.

The game features a mix of:

1. Stealth: Sneak past enemies undetected, using disguises, camouflage, and other tactics.
2. Action: Engage in intense combat sequences against heavily armed foes.
3. Exploration: Explore a large open world (the game's setting is a fictional island) to uncover secrets, find hidden paths, and gather information.

Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is widely considered one of the greatest games of all time, influencing many stealth games that followed.
