Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation and has since become one of the most iconic and influential games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a stealthy operative who must infiltrate enemy bases to gather intelligence and neutralize threats. The gameplay focuses on sneaking past or silently taking out enemies without being detected, using camouflage, disguises, and other gadgets to evade detection.

The game's innovative gameplay mechanics, including the "stealth" system, which allowed players to sneak around undetected, and the use of advanced graphics and sound design, helped establish Metal Gear Solid as a benchmark for stealth games.
