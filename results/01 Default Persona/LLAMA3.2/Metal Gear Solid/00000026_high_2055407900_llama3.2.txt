Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. The game was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become one of the most iconic games in the Metal Gear series.

In Metal Gear Solid, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative, as he infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a terrorist threat known as FOXDIE (a virus that can turn people into cyborgs). The game features stealth gameplay, where players must sneak past or take out enemies undetected, rather than engaging in direct combat.

The game's core mechanics include:

1. Stealth: Players must use cover, disguise, and other tactics to evade detection.
2. Exploration: Players explore the environment, gather information, and complete objectives.
3. Combat: When necessary, players can engage in turn-based combat using a variety of weapons.

Metal Gear Solid was widely praised for its innovative gameplay mechanics, engaging storyline, and memorable characters. It is often credited as one of the greatest games of all time, and has since become a classic in the gaming industry.
