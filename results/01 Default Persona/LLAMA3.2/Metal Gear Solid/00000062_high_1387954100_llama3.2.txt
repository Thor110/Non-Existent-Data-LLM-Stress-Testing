Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. Released in 1998 for the PlayStation, it is considered one of the most influential and iconic games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a threat known as Liquid Snake, a former clone of Big Boss (also known as Naked Snake). The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using stealth mechanics such as camouflage, sound-suppressed movements, and gadgets like binoculars and flashlights.

Metal Gear Solid is widely regarded for its innovative storytelling, characters, and gameplay mechanics, which have since become a staple of the stealth genre.
