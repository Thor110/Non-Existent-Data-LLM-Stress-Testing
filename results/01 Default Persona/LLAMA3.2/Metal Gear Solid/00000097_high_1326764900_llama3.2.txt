Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Konami. The game combines elements of stealth, strategy, and action to create a unique gaming experience.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative, as he infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a terrorist threat. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using camouflage suits, disguises, and other tools to evade detection. The game also features action sequences where Snake must fight against enemies in more direct combat.

Metal Gear Solid is often considered one of the pioneering games in the stealth genre, influencing many subsequent stealth games and series.
