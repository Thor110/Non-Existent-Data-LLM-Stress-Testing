Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the most iconic games of all time.

The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies without being detected, while also completing objectives such as infiltrating enemy bases, gathering intel, and escaping undetected. The game features a mix of stealth, strategy, and action elements, with an emphasis on storytelling, character development, and cinematic presentation.

Metal Gear Solid is known for its innovative gameplay mechanics, including the use of camouflage, radar, and other tools to aid in stealthy movements, as well as the "Quick Time Event" (QTE) system, which adds a layer of interactive drama to the game's cutscenes.
