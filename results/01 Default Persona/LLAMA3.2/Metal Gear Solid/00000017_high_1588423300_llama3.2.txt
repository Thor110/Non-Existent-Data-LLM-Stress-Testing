Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Konami. It combines elements of stealth, action, and puzzle-solving to create a unique gameplay experience.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy bases to gather intel and complete objectives while avoiding detection by enemies. The game features a mix of:

1. Stealth: Sneaking past or silently taking out enemies without alerting others.
2. Action: Engaging in intense combat with firearms and melee attacks when stealth is not possible.
3. Exploration: Exploring large environments, such as bases and facilities, to gather information and complete objectives.

Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become a classic of the action-adventure genre, known for its intricate storyline, memorable characters, and innovative gameplay mechanics.
