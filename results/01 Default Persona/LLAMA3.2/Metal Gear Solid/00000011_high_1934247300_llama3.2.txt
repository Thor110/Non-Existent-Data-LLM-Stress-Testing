Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Hideo Kojima and his team at Konami. The game was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console.

In Metal Gear Solid, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy bases to neutralize threats and uncover conspiracies. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies using stealth mechanics, such as hiding, disguising oneself, and using gadgets like binoculars and grenades.

The game features a mix of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving elements, with a strong emphasis on storytelling and cinematic presentation. It is widely considered one of the greatest games of all time, known for its innovative gameplay mechanics, memorable characters, and thought-provoking narrative.

Over the years, the Metal Gear Solid series has evolved to include other sub-series, such as Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (an action game) and Metal Gear Survive (a survival horror game), but the core gameplay of stealth and strategy remains a key element of the franchise.
