Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It combines elements of stealth, strategy, and action gameplay, where the player must use stealth and strategy to evade detection, sneak past enemies, and complete objectives.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier sent on a mission to infiltrate a terrorist base and neutralize a threat known as "Metsol" (Metal Gear Solid). The game features a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat, with an emphasis on stealth and strategy to evade detection by enemies.

The gameplay involves sneaking past guards, using disguises and camouflage to blend in, and completing objectives without being detected. The game also features a variety of tactics, such as hacking security systems, using camouflage to avoid detection, and employing special abilities like the "Grapple Hook" and "Decoy Camo" to aid in stealth.

Metal Gear Solid is widely considered one of the most influential and innovative games of all time, and its influence can still be seen in many modern stealth games.
