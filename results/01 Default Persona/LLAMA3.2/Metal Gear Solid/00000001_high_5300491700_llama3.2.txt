Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It is the fourth main installment in the Metal Gear series and was released for the PlayStation in 1998.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative who must infiltrate enemy bases and gather intelligence while avoiding detection. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using stealth mechanics such as camouflage, radar, and disguises to remain undetected.

Metal Gear Solid is widely considered a pioneering game in the stealth genre, and its influence can still be seen in many modern action-adventure games.
