Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who must infiltrate enemy territory and complete objectives while avoiding detection by the opposing forces. The game features stealth elements, including camouflage, sneaking past guards, and using disguises to blend in with enemies.

The gameplay involves exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat, but with a focus on stealth and strategy rather than direct action. This unique blend of gameplay mechanics helped establish Metal Gear Solid as a classic in the stealth genre and set the standard for future games in the series.
