Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the greatest games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy bases to gather intelligence and neutralize threats. The gameplay involves sneaking past enemies undetected, using stealth mechanics such as camouflage, noise reduction, and hiding spots, while avoiding detection by guards and other hostile forces.

The game features a mix of action, strategy, and puzzle-solving elements, with an emphasis on storytelling and character development. Metal Gear Solid was a groundbreaking game at the time of its release, known for its complex storyline, memorable characters, and innovative gameplay mechanics.

Over the years, the series has evolved to include various sub-genres such as tactical stealth games, third-person shooters, and even action-adventure games, but the core concept of sneaking past enemies undetected remains a central aspect of the Metal Gear Solid franchise.
