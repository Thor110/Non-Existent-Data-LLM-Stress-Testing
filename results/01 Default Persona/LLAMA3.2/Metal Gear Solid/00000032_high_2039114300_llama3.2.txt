Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It combines elements of stealth, strategy, and action games to create a unique gameplay experience.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a special forces operative, as he infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize threats and retrieve a deadly nuclear warhead known as the "Shagohod" or the "Phantom Pain". The game features a mix of stealth, strategy, and action elements, including:

1. Stealth: Players must sneak past enemies undetected, using disguises, camouflage, and other tactics to evade detection.
2. Strategy: Players can use various strategies such as hacking turrets, creating diversions, or using non-lethal methods to take out enemies without alerting others.
3. Action: The game also features more intense action sequences, where players must fight their way through enemy strongholds or defend against heavy artillery.

Metal Gear Solid was a groundbreaking game that introduced many innovations in the stealth genre and has since become a classic of the series, influencing numerous other games and films.
