Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. Released in 1998, it is considered one of the most influential and critically acclaimed games of all time.

In Metal Gear Solid, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territories to neutralize threats to world peace. The game features a mix of stealth, strategy, and action elements, with an emphasis on sneaking past enemies undetected, using disguises and camouflage, and avoiding detection by radar systems.

The gameplay involves exploring open environments, completing objectives, and fighting against enemies in intense combat sequences. Metal Gear Solid also introduced several innovative mechanics, such as the "Stealth Camouflage" system, which allowed players to blend into their surroundings, and the "Quick Time Event" (QTE) system, which added a layer of interactive cinematics to the gameplay.

Overall, Metal Gear Solid is a classic example of a stealth action game that has influenced many other titles in the genre.
