Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth video game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a threat known as FOXDIE, which has been stolen by the villainous Liquid Snake. The gameplay revolves around stealth, strategy, and action elements, with an emphasis on sneaking past or silently taking out enemies without being detected.

The game introduced many innovations in stealth gameplay, such as the "stealth cam" system, which allowed players to observe and analyze enemy movements before making a move. It also featured a narrative-driven storyline with complex characters and themes, which helped establish Metal Gear Solid as a cult classic and paved the way for numerous sequels and spin-offs.

Overall, Metal Gear Solid is an example of the stealth-action genre, blending elements of action-adventure games with stealth gameplay to create a unique and engaging experience.
