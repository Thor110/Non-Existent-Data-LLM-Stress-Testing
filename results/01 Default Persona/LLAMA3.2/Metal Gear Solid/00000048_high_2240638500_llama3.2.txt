Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to neutralize a threat known as " FOXDIE", which has been stolen from the US government. The gameplay involves stealth, strategy, and action elements, where players must use camouflage, sneak past enemies, and take out targets without being detected.

The game's innovative features included:

1. 3D gameplay: Metal Gear Solid was one of the first games to heavily feature 3D graphics.
2. Stealth mechanics: Players had to use stealth tactics, such as hiding behind objects and using disguises, to evade detection.
3. Camera system: The game introduced a camera system that allowed players to move around the environment while maintaining a clear view of Snake's surroundings.

Metal Gear Solid's success led to the creation of several sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, cementing its place as one of the most iconic games in the stealth genre.
