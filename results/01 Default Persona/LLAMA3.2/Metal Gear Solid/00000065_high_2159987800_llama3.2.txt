Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. The game was released in 1998 for the PlayStation and is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

In Metal Gear Solid, players control Solid Snake, a soldier who infiltrates enemy territory to gather intel and neutralize threats. The gameplay focuses on stealth, strategy, and tactics, as players must use disguises, camouflage, and other tools to sneak past or silently eliminate enemies.

The game features elements of action, exploration, and puzzle-solving, with an emphasis on storytelling and character development. Metal Gear Solid's innovative gameplay mechanics, such as the use of radar and binoculars to detect enemy movements, and the "sneaking" system, which rewards players for moving quietly and avoiding detection, helped to establish it as a genre-defining game in the stealth action-adventure category.

The game's success spawned a series of sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, among others.
