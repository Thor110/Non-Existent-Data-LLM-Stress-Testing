Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. Released in 1998 for the PlayStation, it is considered one of the most influential and iconic games of all time.

In Metal Gear Solid, players control Solid Snake, a former Green Beret soldier who must infiltrate a highly secured facility called Shadow Moses Island to neutralize a terrorist threat known as FOXHOUND. The game features stealth mechanics, such as sneaking past enemies undetected, using disguises and camouflage, and avoiding detection through the use of radar and other tools.

The gameplay involves exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat, with an emphasis on strategy and tactics. Metal Gear Solid also features a rich storyline, memorable characters, and a distinctive visual style that has become synonymous with the series.

Over the years, the Metal Gear Solid series has evolved to include various sub-series, such as Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (an action-adventure game) and Metal Gear Survive (a survival game), but the core gameplay mechanics of stealth, strategy, and storytelling have remained a staple of the franchise.
