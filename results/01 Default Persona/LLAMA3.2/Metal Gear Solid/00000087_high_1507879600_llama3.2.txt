Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become a classic in the gaming industry.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a secret agent who must infiltrate enemy bases to gather intelligence and neutralize threats. The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using stealth mechanics such as hiding, crouching, and camouflage, while avoiding detection by the enemy's guards and security systems.

The game also features a strong focus on storytelling, with a complex narrative that explores themes of war, identity, and loyalty. Metal Gear Solid is widely regarded as one of the greatest games of all time, and its influence can still be seen in many modern stealth games.
