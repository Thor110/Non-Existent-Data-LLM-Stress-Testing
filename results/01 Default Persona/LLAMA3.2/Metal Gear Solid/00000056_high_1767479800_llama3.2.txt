Metal Gear Solid is an action-adventure stealth game developed by Konami. It was first released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and is considered one of the most influential games of all time.

In the game, players control Solid Snake, a secret agent who must infiltrate enemy bases to gather intel and neutralize threats. The game features stealth gameplay mechanics, such as sneaking past enemies undetected, using disguises, and exploiting ventilation shafts and other hiding spots.

However, Metal Gear Solid also incorporates elements of action games, with fast-paced combat sequences against enemy soldiers and bosses. The game's story is also known for its complexity and depth, with a large cast of characters and multiple plot twists.

The success of Metal Gear Solid spawned a successful series, including sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, as well as several adaptations in other media, such as films and manga.
