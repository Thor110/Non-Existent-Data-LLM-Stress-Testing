Metal Gear Solid is a stealth action-adventure game developed by Konami. It is a third-person perspective game that focuses on stealth, strategy, and storytelling. Players control the protagonist, Solid Snake, as he infiltrates enemy territory to gather intel and neutralize threats.

The gameplay involves sneaking past or silently taking out enemies, using camouflage and disguises to evade detection, and solving puzzles to progress through the story. The game also features elements of action and combat, but stealth is a primary aspect of the gameplay experience.

Metal Gear Solid was released in 1998 for the PlayStation console and has since become a cult classic, widely regarded as one of the best games of all time. It has spawned numerous sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, including Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, among others.
